OUSDS brings people together for easy-to-learn, social, and fun nights of dancing. Perhaps youÂ have attended a ceilidh, or seen people dancing to bagpipes and wanted to try it! OUSDS welcomes novices as well as seasoned dancers for professionally taught classes each week. We are a vibrant community, holding social dances and ceilidhs throughout term. There are also opportunities to go on dancing residentials in Scotland and abroad if you can't get enough!
