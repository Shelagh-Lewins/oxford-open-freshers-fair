Q: Do I need to have drama experience?
A: No! Even if you've never been onstage in your life, you're very welcome to come down and get stuck in.

Q: Did I read that bit about auditions right?
A: Yes! Anyone who auditions will be given a part either onstage or backstage, whichever they want.

Q: When are auditions?
A: Auditions for this term's virtual production 'Cinderella: The Musical' will be held on Sunday 11th October from 7:30-9:30pm via Zoom. If you're interested here's the zoom link, and use it to join us then. They are very informal and you don't need to prepare anything! We'll give you an audition script to read.

Q: When are rehearsals?
A: OULES rehearsals are always on Wednesday and Sunday, 7pm till 10pm. Usually we'd have a rehearsal room at an available college venue, but since this term we're doing a virtual play to upload on Youtube, we'll use Zoom for scene rehearsing and Discord for general chats for everyone to get to know each other.
