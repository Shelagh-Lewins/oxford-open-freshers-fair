Q: What does AerOx do? 
A: We mainly organise talks and workshops! We want to connect the student body to the leading figures in the aeronautical world, to showcase their work, and to inspire students to go into that domain. 

Q: How can I be involved? 
A: In any way you like! If you want to just come along (virtually) to our talks, it's free and easy. If you want to spearhead a project, get in touch. If you'd like to join the committee, we have some open spots too!

Q: Do I need to be a STEM and/or student?
A: Not at all! We're keen for anyone who's interested and hope to make our events broad enough to engage with as many of you as possible.
