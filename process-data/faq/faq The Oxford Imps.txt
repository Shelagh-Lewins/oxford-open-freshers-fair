Q: Who are The Oxford Imps? 
A: The Oxford Imps are an improv comedy troupe made up of students and locals, performing live comedy, made up on the spot, for over 15 years. We have performed all over the world, from the yearly Edinburgh Fringe to our US and South Africa tours. Our Alumn-imps include BAFTA winner Rachel Parris and Edinburgh Comedy Award nominee Sophie Duker. 

Q: What is improv comedy? 
A: Improvised comedy is comedy made up on the spot, based on the audience's suggestions. Everything we do is completely unplanned, and this means that every performance is totally unique! 
Check out Who's Line is it Anyway?, Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix, or The Noise Next Door from Britain's Got Talent if you want a clearer idea of what improv is, or better yet, come and see one of our shows! We love introducing new audiences to our made-up fun. 

Q: How do I get involved? 
A: We hold auditions every year! Usually, we hold auditions in October, but this year we have moved them to January 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subscribe to our mailing list on www.oxfordimps.com if you would like the most up to date information about our shows and auditions. 
We are hoping to use our extra time before auditions this year to encourage people who might not usually come along to auditions to give improv a try. That's why we are hosting several online AND in-person, socially distanced improv workshops in October.
