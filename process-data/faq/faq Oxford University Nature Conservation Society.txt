Q: What events does your society hold?
A: We hold weekly talks on a wide range of conservation issues from biodiversity at airports to elephants in Mali and the illegal plant trade. We also try to hold a couple of practical nature activities every term that can either by guided nature walks at places within Oxford or practical conservation activities on local reserves or wildlife areas.
