The Oxford University Catholic Chaplaincy is a space for Catholic students and staff to meet, socialise, learn, relax, pray and share their faith.
We host regular events which will form you in different aspects of our faith, and help you meet other Catholics while at University.
We encourage and equip students to engage in University life, for the common good and as ambassadors of Christ, and to respond positively to the challenges of our world today.
