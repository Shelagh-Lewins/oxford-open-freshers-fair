As a mix of Handball, Dodgeball and Rugby, it is unlike any other sport in the world.<br />Since no one has really had a chance to try Quidditch before coming to Uni, everyone gets to start on at the same level regardless of how much sport they may have done beforehand. We train Wednesdays and Sundays every week, and go to national tournaments to compete against university teams across the country! Even if you want something more casually though, you’ll always be welcome at trainings.<br />Finally, everyone at OUQC is super welcoming and we have weekly socials on Thursday evenings where we just have a bit of a laugh.<br />You can chat to us at the Freshers’ Fair, or message us on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/OxUniQuidditch","FAQs":"Q: How does it work...?<br />A: This is almost always the first question people ask. The sport itself is a mix of Handball, Dodgeball and Rugby. Each team has 3 chasers, who try to throw a ball (the Quaffle) through the opposing hoops,1 keeper, who defends the hoops, and 2 beaters, who throw dodgeballs (the Bludgers) at enemy players, taking them out of the game for a short time. Finally, each team has 1 seeker who comes into play after 18mins and tries to catch the Snitch, which ends the game. The Snitch itself is a bit like tag-rugby, where the seekers have to remove a tennis ball in a sock velcroed to the back of an unbiased person's shorts. And of course, all of this is done on \"brooms\", which are 3 foot plastic tubes that you have to hold between your legs at all times. <br />This is quite a long answer, but the best way to find out what it's actually like is to come and try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Q: When and where do you train, and is there a particular training that is fresher friendly?<br />A: We usually train in the Oxford University Parks on Wednesdays and Sundays from 2pm to 4pm. You can find many more details on our website, facebook and other socials medias. We have some taster sessions in the next couple weeks so you can come and give it a go! However, new people will always be welcome to join in with any one of our trainings.<br /><br />Q: What if I haven't really done any sport before university?<br />A: Quidditch is the perfect sport to start at uni because no one has ever done it before! So you don't need to worry about trying out or embarrassing yourself or having to play with people who played since they were 6, because everyone is welcome and everyone starts on the same level. Naturally there are lots of transferable skills from other sports, such as basic throwing and catching, but those can be picked up relatively quickly.<br /><br />Q: What if I don't think I could commit time or money to the club and just want to train for fun occasionally?<br />A: You will always be welcome at trainings even if you don't want to go to any tournaments. No one will expect you to turn up regularly if that is what you would like to do. We all have busy lives so feel free to come along and have a laugh. In terms of money, we cost (almost no) money: the club membership is free for your first term and is only £10 per term or £25 per year after that, so the club is one of the cheapest sports clubs in the uni. This money is then used to subsidise tournament costs for players and maintain the club equipment.<br /><br />Q: Is the sport mixed gender?<br />A: Not only are quidditch teams mixed gender, it is multi-gender in that players play as the gender they choose and identify as. You can then have at most 4 players of any one gender on pitch at the same time, for example 4 female players, 2 male players and 1 non-binary player.<br /><br />Q: How much does it cost?<br />A: Your first term is free! After that, membership costs £10 per term or £25 for the year. We would normally have regular tournaments we would go to which cost a little extra, but those won't be happening until at least after Christmas.<br /><br />Q: How are things happening with Covid?<br />A: There are three things Coronavirus has changed for us, tournaments, trainings and socials. Having to organise safely playing a contact sport in times of Covid is not easy. There won't be any of the tournaments we would have expected to go to until at least after Christmas, and it is unclear in what respect they will be held. We have also gone to great lengths to make sure our trainings and taster sessions will be Covid safe, with the help of guidelines from the government and Quidditch UK. Our socials have moved to online socials rather than in person socials, but we are going to try to have a couple of big socials in person."},{"additionalPageURL":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JA7S3Rqg9mbVK4w5DXi_83prbphNgVSY6Ub2DhZWD10/edit?usp=sharing","category":"Music","introVideoURL":"","emailSignupAddress":"","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/OUCeilidhBand","ID":"8","instagramURL":"http://www.instagram.com/ouceilidhband","logoFilename":"img/logos/8.jpg","name":"Oxford University Ceilidh Band","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YTQyZDlmYmMtYTlmYS00Y2IwLWJkNTYtODMzODk4N2QzMTMy%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22e09c5d8f-e7ee-44c7-82ab-243ba2343b71%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"http://ouceilidhband.org/","description":"We are a completely non-auditioning ceilidh band playing folk music and putting on ceilidhs in Oxford.

At the core of our program is 1-1 mentorship, where we match an applicant from less privileged backgrounds with a mentor studying their dream degree at their dream university. We hope you will join us in fighting inequality in higher education!","FAQs":"Q: What is Project Access and what do we do? <br />A: We’re a student-led, global non-profit organisation founded in 2016. At Project Access, we believe that the current university application system must change and the playing field must be levelled for underprivileged students.  <br />Here’s how we do this: <br />1. 1-1 mentorship: This is our core. Mentors work closely with mentees by accompanying them through the application process, providing advice and support along the way. Our mentors receive training and have access to our bank of resources to assist in their mentorship (e.g. a guide to conduct mock interviews). <br />2. Classes: Every mentee joins a class of fellow applicants, enabling our mentees to form friendships before university and to have access to webinars and written resources to further support their application (e.g. a guide for their referee). <br />3. Access Academy: our newest initiative, is aimed at students at the pre-application stage and provides resources such as blogs and webinars to give insight into the application process and what life is like at a top university. <br />4. Bootcamps: We organise bootcamps in various countries where applicants come together for workshops and trainings. <br /><br />Q: How can I help? <br />A: Become a mentor! You will help an aspiring applicant by providing them with encouragement, application support and tips and tricks to navigate the application process. Through our pairing system, we will try our best to pair you with a mentee applying from the same country as you and for the same course at the same university, meaning you will be best placed to assist in their application.  <br />With just 1-2 hours a month, this is a low commitment but hugely impactful role in which you can empower underprivileged applicants, help them achieve their full potential and advance the cause of equal opportunity and access in education.  <br />Sign up today to become a mentor: https://projectaccess.org/become-a-mentor <br /><br />Q: How do I benefit from being a mentor? <br />A: 1. Make a difference in a mentee’s life (imagine the support you wish you had when you decided where to study or how to write your personal statement – or perhaps you had the support yourself but feel frustrated that so many don’t!) <br />2. Develop your interpersonal skills <br />3. Join a network of 2000+ active mentors around the world and across some of the world’s best universities.  <br />4. Gain access to regular events such as mentor socials and exclusive careers events with panellists from high-profile firms (past examples include ‘Breaking into Finance’ and ‘How to get an Internship’). <br />Q: Who will I be helping by joining Project Access? <br />A: Our program is entirely free for students, thanks to our volunteers, donors and partners. In turn, we promise to offer our program to the students who need it.  <br />Students are deemed eligible for our program if they can prove that they are facing barriers in at least one of the following four categories: <br />- Socio-economics: e.g. if they’re the first in their family to go to university or come from a low-income family <br />- Demographics: e.g. if they come from a small city or from an immigrant community <br />- Geography: e.g. if they come from a region where few students go abroad to study at top universities <br />- Information and support: e.g. if their school does not offer a lot of support<br /><br />Q: Can I become even more involved, besides being a mentor? <br />A: Absolutely! Read about our open positions here (and apply!): https://projectaccess.org/join-our-team <br />Here’s also an overview of our Teams: <br />- Campus Teams: Our community heroes! They are responsible for recruiting and training our fantastic mentors, and ensures that everyone in PA are included and feels like they are a part of our trailblazer community.<br />- Country Teams: They focus on supporting the students who need our help! They build long-lasting partnership with schools and corporate partners to grow our mission and create fantastic events for our mentees, such as bootcamps and workshops. This is hands-on work and truly inspiring teams to work with.<br />- Global Teams: To support our amazing campus and country teams, we have our global teams to develop the backbone of operations. We support through IT services, Talent development, entrepreneurial product management, and creative marketing!"},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Dance & Theatre","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l31bsWTN3TA&t=1s","emailSignupAddress":"","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/hofimprov","ID":"15","instagramURL":"http://www.instagram.com/hofimprov","logoFilename":"img/logos/15.png","name":"The House of Improv","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MTczNjE2MzMtYjQ0Mi00ZTFiLWIwYTUtOGRkZmI4OTViOTQy%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22ee0b541d-2753-4e25-8715-3c427f921d71%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDSeomuXbKBRAwzOiQl7Ug","websiteURL":"","description":"The House of Improv is an Oxford-based improvised comedy troupe, who run workshops and perform regularly, doing longform, shortform, and all manner of improv inbetween! We will be hosting a series of events for freshers and looking for new members of the troupe!","FAQs":"What is Improv?<br />Improvised comedy, or Improv for short, is a type of theatre without a script: dialogue, plot points, dramatic twists and even characters are made up on the fly, often based on audience suggestions. Improv can be anything from a quick 20 second sketch to an hour long show. While it might seem scary at first, this lack of script makes taking part in improv dynamic, exciting, and just as interesting for the actor as the audience. Its always spontaneous, sometimes silly and never the same twice!<br />What is the House Of Improv?<br />We are an improv group who put on shows and who run workshops for any student to attend, whether they want to take to the stage themselves or just have a bit of fun! We aim to create a friendly, supportive and inclusive space where people can let down their inhibitions and just say the first thing that comes into their head! <br />Do I have to have done it before?<br />No! Our open workshops start with the assumption that you’ve never tried improv before, and builds up from there, and coming one week doesn’t commit you to coming next week. Improv is easy to learn and great fun, so please come along and have a go! <br />How will improv be socially distant?<br />Due to covid-related woes, we are currently planning to run our workshops virtually, at least for Michelmas term, over Zoom. Never before has it been so easy to do improv in your pyjamas! We’re keen to experiment with the unique challenges and opportunities online improv presents us with, but we’ll also be giving out a take home Intro to Improv, that should run you through everything you need to try out in person improv with your bubble-friends.<br />Can I join the House of Improv? <br />Yes! Each year we recruit new members through a series of relaxed auditions. These are for everyone, from first timers to experienced improvisers and run similarly to our open workshops. Being a member means getting to do even more improv and the opportunity to perform in some shows too, which in the past have included the Edinburgh and Brighton fringe festivals! Due to virus, the nature and timing of these auditions is still uncertain, but it is easy to stay informed…<br />How to stay informed about our events and workshops?<br />Like our Facebook pages ‘The House of Improv Open workshops’ and ‘The House of improv’ to receive updates about this term’s activities! <br />Do I have to join?<br />Absolutely not! Open workshops are designed to allow non-members to continue practicing improv with us, so that no one misses out on the fun! There is no commitment to these sessions, so you can attend as often as you wish."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Cultural","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CccsPXYmd5c","emailSignupAddress":"","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/oxfordindiasociety","ID":"16","instagramURL":"http://www.instagram.com/oxfordindiasoc","logoFilename":"img/logos/16.png","name":"University of Oxford India Society","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MDlhZDg1ZjEtNDUwMS00NTUyLWIwZDItYmM5ZDQwY2YwYzdi%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22f013b68e-6590-4b39-9bb2-e237942d3960%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"https://ois.org.uk/","description":"We are the official student home for India and Indians on campus.

This one-to-one support has been proven to improve academic performance at school and raise the child’s confidence outside the classroom.<br />We also hold fun events and outings for children involved in the Jacari scheme, and within the university sphere we seek to raise awareness of the issues facing the communities we work in through events for students and the public.<br />We recruit and train student volunteers on an ongoing basis and hope you will be one of them!","FAQs":"Q: What’s the weekly time commitment?<br />A: One hour of tutoring a week during term time, so it can easily fit around your academic work and other activities! Additionally, when we resume face-to-face tutoring, you will have to travel no more than 30 minutes by your preferred mode of transport to reach your pupil--we want to keep it simple for you!<br /><br />Q: What’s the registration process?<br />A: All volunteers must complete an Enhanced DBS check (paid for by Jacari), go through our training process (which includes a virtual Safeguarding Training, Volunteer Induction, and Tutoring Training--in total, just about 2.5 hours), and provide a character reference. If you are an international student, the process may look slightly different for you--contact our Lead Coordinator at oxford@jacari.org to find out more!<br /><br />Q: I have no teaching experience. Can I still sign up?<br />A: Yes! Our Tutoring Training should give you ideas of how you can structure your lessons, but you also have a lot of freedom to be creative--the main thing is to understand the needs of your pupil and to help them gain confidence in their English. We also have a library of teaching materials and games at our office on Cowley Road as well as loads of digital resources on our website!<br /><br />Q: Do I need to know a foreign language to tutor?<br />A: Not at all! Lots of our volunteers only speak English and most of our volunteers do not speak the first language of their pupil. This is completely fine and you will still be able to provide amazing tuition regardless. <br /><br />Q: How will teaching work this year?<br />A: Due to current circumstances, all volunteer tutoring will be online this autumn and using Moodle, a virtual learning platform. If the situation improves, we may resume face-to-face teaching next term, but this is uncertain for now.<br /><br />Q: What does a typical Jacari lesson look like?<br />A: It’s up to you! Jacari’s virtual training sessions will give you lots of tips and ideas for structuring your teaching, but you can use Jacari’s worksheets and resources in any way that works for you and your pupil. You can also use external resources! <br />Typically, volunteers do anything from playing games to doing worksheets to reading with their pupils. Lessons are supposed to be fun and flexible--not just an extension of the school day!<br /><br />Q: How can Jacari help me in my future career?<br />A: Once you complete 16 hours of tutoring (the minimum we ask you to do over the course of 1 year so we make sure each pupil is well supported), we can provide you with a certificate of your teaching commitment and the Lead Coordinator will be happy to write you personal references for job and internship applications! Your work with Jacari looks great on your CV even if you’re not looking to head into a career in education or teaching.<br /><br />Q: Where can I learn more about Jacari?<br />A: You can find us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn at ‘Jacari Oxford’ or check out our website: www.jacari.org.

These may be crafts, parties or bowling. We also run volunteer events, such as open mic nights, and quizzes. Though in-person events will not be happening this term we will be putting on several online events."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Academic","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WG3ibvCwI-s","emailSignupAddress":"https://www.aerox.space/join-us","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/OUAerOx/","ID":"19","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/19.png","name":"Oxford University Aeronautical Society - AerOx","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NmQ3YjE4MzItNzk0Ny00ZTJkLTg0ZGEtYTc4OTM2ZmM2MmJi%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22929a70e1-349f-412c-9df3-d4a0472748ab%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLIUO-pvUMfMhLhmDe63jcw","websiteURL":"www.aerox.space","description":"AerOx has its main objectives being the support, development and promotion of aeronautical knowledge, both theoretical and practical, through activities and events in the University of Oxford.","FAQs":"Q: What does AerOx do? <br />A: We mainly organise talks and workshops!

Tolkien, C.B.E., all while having fun (and plenty of free cake!). See our Facebook page!<br />During term, we meet every Friday, usually in Christ Church. Our meetings take a variety of forms, but all are fun and sociable and include food provided by our Lembas Reps. The current termcard has more information on our planned meetings. Common events in previous years include:<br />In Michaelmas - The Freshers' Moot drinks evening, a Tolkien's Oxford tour, a Trial (or, more recently, election debate), and the Gandalf's Fireworks party.<br />In Hilary - Most of the events focus on preparation for the Varsity Quiz against our counterparts in Cambridge, Minas Tirith, or our biggest annual event, the Society Banquet.<br />In Trinity - A large variety of outdoors events, including outdoor games, the Golfimbul BBQ, the Strawberry Party, and plenty of punting.<br />General meetings throughout the year include video meetings, crafts events, dramatic readings, or games evenings.<br />Number and content of events this Michaelmas will likely be modified to accommodate online formats, but we’d do our best to retain as many usual elements as possible despite the possible limitation on offline meet-ups.<br />One question we are frequently asked is how big a fan you need to be to attend society meetings - the answer is that everyone is welcome, from those who have read the Silmarillion multiple times, to those who have just seen the films, or maybe only have a budding interest in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Taruithorn has no entry requirements: we simply want people to come along and have fun - if you happen to learn something new about Tolkien along the way, all the better!<br />The running of the society is organised by the committee. The committee is elected by the society at the AGM every Hilary, and all members of the society are invited to come and exercise their democratic right and have their say on the running of the society.<br />Miruvor, our society magazine, is now published in a digital format as a blog here and submissions are welcomed by the editor - see the blog for details. Some old issues are held in digital form in our Digital Archive, while others exist as paper copies in the Society Archive, accessible on request.<br />Our Digital Archive holds a variety of important or interesting documents, including the constitution, past termcards and varsity quiz questions, old issues of Miruvor, the society's list of Heroes, and the old version of this website, which was overhauled in 2013.<br />For more information please refer to our website: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tolksoc/index.html.<br />To contact the society, or to sign up to one of the mailing lists, please email us at taruithorn@gmail.com.","FAQs":"Q: Who can join the society? <br />A: Everyone is welcome, from those who have read the Silmarillion multiple times, to those who have just seen the films, or maybe only have a budding interest in the works of J.R.R.

Our flagship project runs on a Saturday morning, where we provide a drop-in for members of the homeless community.

We re-launched just this year after a years-long hiatus and aim to sign up people to the stem cell register through various events, as well as raise awareness of and funds for the stem cell register.","FAQs":"Q: What is the stem cell register?<br />A: The stem cell register is a genetic data bank into which all potential donors are entered. If someone needs a donation, their information is run through the register to find out whether or not there is a suitable donor. While chances to find a donor vary due to a number of factors, the larger the database, the larger the chance to save a life!<br /><br />Q: What does signing up to the register involve? Do I have to give blood?<br />A: Signing up is the first step. Once you're registered, your information is stored on the register for 30 years. After that, nothing really happens until there's a genetic match. this may happen extremely quickly, it can also take years, or never happen at all. But if there is a match, you will be asked to donate either stem cells via the bloodstream or be asked to donate bone marrow, depending on the situation. Both procedures are entirely painless!<br /><br />Q: How often do people usually donate?<br />A: If there is a match, you will be asked to donate. After the donation is complete (in some cases, you may be called upon to donate multiple times for the same person) you will be taken off the register for two years. After two years, you will be asked whether or not you want to re-join. If you do, there may be another chance of you saving a life!<br /><br />Q: What does volunteering with us involve?<br />A: It depends. If you decide to join the committee, you will help in organizing and running events such as fundraisers and donor recruitment across the university, as well as be in contact with UK Marrow and participate in various conferences, regional and national. If you decide to volunteer outside the committee, you can help us run the events on the day itself and help us advertise them on your college's JCR and with your friends.<br /><br />Q: Are there medical conditions preventing me from donating?<br />A: Yes. When you fill in the form to register, it will ask you to provide medical background. On the basis of this, it will be determined whether you are eligible to donate. There is a catalogue as well of the various conditions that need to be disclosed and how far they do or do not impact you wanting to donate.<br /><br />Q: Are there any health risks in donating stem cells/bone marrow?<br />A: While no medical procedure is entirely risk free, there are virtually no risks associated to donating bone marrow/stem cells. You will probably feel under the weather for a couple of days, and that's mostly it. Maintaining trust in the procedure is critical to save as many lives as possible, so all necessary precautions are taken."},{"additionalPageURL":"https://twitter.com/OxWoCS","category":"Careers","introVideoURL":"","emailSignupAddress":"https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=G96VzPWXk0-0uv5ouFLPkbA9E66e0I5Kt5My4iWBexpUQlpDNUY4SlA2V0Y5QlRPV0ExTEJEWkJDMC4u","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/OxWoCS","ID":"29","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/29.png","name":"OxWoCS (Oxford Women in Computer Science Society)","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MTAxOTM1NDMtNmFhMy00YjViLThmY2UtNTZjNjQ0N2RiYThk%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22ae133db0-d09e-4a8e-b793-32e225817b1a%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/societies/women/index.html","description":"The Oxford Women in Computer Science Society (OxWoCS) aims to support and promote women in computer science.

We also run educational programmes throughout the year, including our award winning School of climate change seminar programme, delivered by leading Climate academics from Oxford University. This year it will be in an online format and applications open so we encourage you all to apply if interested! We also run the world’s largest student-led climate journal, Anthroposphere. And over the longer term, we are working with the university to develop net-zero policies and also incorporate climate change into the Oxford curriculum.<br /><br />Q: How can I get further involved with OCS?<br />A: Beyond attending our weekly events, there are many ways to get involved with OCS: For example, we run sustainability workshops which help guide students (and staff) who want to push their college to create more sustainable policies. We also run the Oxford School of Climate Change which is a selective group of students that undertake a award-winning holistic seminar series on climate change. We encourage all interested students to apply via the link on our website. Our Media team are also always looking for contributes to the OCS blog as well as positions in social media and as photographers. Lastly, we often open up positions to get involved with our sub-committees to help work on the various projects we have at OCS, so do sign up to our newsletter and various social media platforms to stay tuned for announcements on these positions!<br /><br />Q: What happens if I miss the live-streamed YouTube events? <br />A: All of our events, (at the permission of our speakers) are uploaded after the live-stream directly to our YouTube channel so you can watch on demand wherever and whenever you like! The only difference is that you won't get the opportunity to ask questions to the speaker as we take requests via the live-chat box on the YouTube live-stream. <br /><br />Q: Are there Opportunities for more Art-based students within OCS?<br />A: Yes, absolutely. At OCS we are working to diversify the ways to engage with climate change that span all the ways from the sciences to the arts. So if you enjoy writing, there are opportunities to write for our blog. We also have our own Zine, RISE, where we welcome all forms of work, from poetry to art to music. We also have cut and stick sessions which you can get involved with. In addition, we are increasingly covering the topics of art and how we communicate climate change within our weekly events."},{"additionalPageURL":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/oxfordlongevity","category":"Academic","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Rh3r5exyFg&feature=youtu.be","emailSignupAddress":"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j4xMl-PKTbfiwHOwxuk-shqXzfRlvfMnAVZBYDnOgzg/edit","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/oxfordlongevity","ID":"32","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/32.jpg","name":"Oxford Longevity Society","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NDlmMWM2NzItZjkyMS00YWZmLWI5YzUtMDQxZTkyYzFhMjQ5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22541a8659-51c4-402d-aefb-ba8294d7e2ba%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"","description":"The Oxford Longevity Society aims to foster insightful discussion surrounding scientific breakthroughs in aging and longevity.

Bach, Mendelssohn, and Martin Luther were each active.","FAQs":"Q: How do I sign up to audition?<br />A: Please fill in this form, which has all the details: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbZaxCDdUe2xrNTVxRersz8wSM88AQINZ9mOFMNThzJ6Gmng/viewform<br /><br />Q: How big is the choir?<br />A: We're aiming to have 24 singers this year.<br /><br />Q: What voice parts are you looking for?<br />A: All of them! We're especially short on altos this year.<br /><br />Q: What's the time commitment during the term?<br />A: In normal times, we sing three services per week: on Tuesday and Friday at 6.15 PM with rehearsal at 5.00 PM prior to each, then Sunday at 6.00 PM with rehearsal beginning at 4.15 PM. There is also a 90 minute midweek rehearsal on Wednesdays from 6.30 PM. In Michaelmas 2020 due to COVID restrictions, instead of singing three services per week, every member of the choir will sing two: one with the full choir but no congregation, with masks and distanced at two metres throughout the chapel which will be recorded and broadcast online; the second a part of a quartet with a live congregation (also distanced at two metres with masks). The quartet services happen daily except for Wednesday and Saturday.<br /><br />Q: What does an audition look like?<br />A: We try to keep it fairly informal. You'll prepare a piece of your choosing (any genre, memorisation not required), then we'll ask you to do some basic vocal exercises to test your range, and we'll end with some sight-reading. The whole thing takes about 10 minutes, and we're offering both in-person auditions in the College Chapel during Freshers' Week, or online via Zoom.<br />Q: What kind of music do you sing?<br />A: A bit of everything, really. The Anglican cathedral tradition is at the heart of what we do — lots of Stanford, Howells, Byrd, etc. — but we also perform a lot of music from the broader Western tradition like Bach, Palestrina, Mozart, etc. We also frequently sing pieces by those who were marginalised during their lifetimes, namely BAME, women, and LGBTQ+ composers. Being an academic institution, we also premiere at least one new work per term, often by graduate composition students at the Faculty of Music.<br /><br />Q: Do you have any special events outside of Oxford this year?<br />A: Absolutely! This summer we're taking a tour to Saxony to sing in the churches where Bach, Martin Luther, and Mendelssohn were active. In Hilary term (February 2021) we'll sing evensong at St Paul's Cathedral in London as a guest choir."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Cultural","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/td83GTjOdu4","emailSignupAddress":"","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/oxfordinternationalsociety/","ID":"35","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/35.png","name":"Oxford International Society","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YjU1OTNjNDItMTM5ZC00Yjg3LThkODktMzdmZWVjYzczNDBk%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22b1e00d30-0198-4bbe-beaf-16d848055617%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"","description":"Oxford International Society hosts social events for international students across the university.

We organise and attend peaceful rallies and protests against climate injustice, such as at career events with fossil fuel companies present. Apart from direct action, we also focus on education and discussion about the most pressing issues relating to climate change and social justice. Our achievements include the divestment campaign, which saw the University pledge to divest its endowment from fossil fuels this year; we continue to campaign for fossil fuel divestment in the individual colleges of the University.","FAQs":"Q: What does OCJC do?<br />A: The Oxford Climate Justice Campaign is a student activist group focused on cutting ties between the university and fossil fuel sector, and acting in solidarity with the frontline communities most affected by climate change. We go about this by a mixture of lobbying, protesting and peaceful direct actions, and recently got the central university to agree to divest its’ endowment from fossil fuels. We also work together with other intersectional student campaigns from time to time. <br /><br />Q: What do you want to achieve?<br />A: Although the central university is now divesting from fossil fuels, there are still many colleges with investments into them, and those are far from the only links. We want the university and colleges to immediately cut all ties with the sector, including accepting funding/donations, advertising jobs in fossil fuel companies, or doing research for them- among other things.<br /><br />Q: What’s climate justice?<br />A: Climate justice is a framework for looking at the climate crisis that focuses on the injustices caused by climate change and fossil fuel extraction, and demands solutions to the crisis that put the needs and human rights of marginalised communities first. It focuses on the fact those least responsible for the crisis will be most affected by it, and brings to light and challenges things such as the colonialism and violations of indigenous rights involved in oil extraction, while challenging greenwashing that lets oil companies off the hook or blames the global poor for their own oppression.<br /><br />Q: What are OCJC’s values more broadly?<br />A: OCJC is radical, democratic, non-hierarchical, dynamic, acts in solidarity with the communities most affected by climate change, and is LGBTQ+ affirming, egalitarian, anti-racist and intersectional (that is, we think the liberation of different marginalised groups are mutually bound together). Our core focus is on the justice aspect of climate justice, and the intersection between climate change and social justice.<br /><br />Q: Sounds cool, how do I get involved?<br />A: Put your name down on the sign-up sheet to join our mailing lists and get details of when we have our main meetings, which we use to plan actions, discuss what we want to focus our campaigning efforts on, organise in other ways and the like. In the past we usually met on Wednesday 6pm for around an hour with a social afterwards during term time and did most other organising on Slack. Due to COVID, our meetings are going to be virtual for the foreseeable future, sign up to the mailing list and join the Slack to get the meeting details."},{"additionalPageURL":"http://www.twitter.com/OxPsySoc","category":"Other","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AUhUwCAJqcU","emailSignupAddress":"oxpsysoc.org","facebookURL":"www.facebook.com/oxpsysoc","ID":"46","instagramURL":"www.instagram.com/oxfordpsychedelicsociety","logoFilename":"img/logos/46.png","name":"Oxford Psychedelic Society","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ODk2Zjc4MDYtM2I1Ni00MDE1LWIzZWUtOTMxMjg5NGFlMjkw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22e4687a6e-64d0-4347-b7c5-4600c1001ca9%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfoUteV5TkHewU8gHNeuBtg","websiteURL":"www.oxpsysoc.org/","description":"We host talks and events exploring all facets of psychedelia - the science and medical applications of psychedelics, as well as psychedelic history and culture - alongside a range of social and healing activities.

Any medium: books, TV, movies, games, comics, mind-meld.<br /><br />Q: What sort of meetings do you do?<br />A: We meet once a week, via Zoom at the moment, for a discussion. This can mean serious discussions on futuristic topics or particular authors, light hearted debates about what thing is the best, a presentation on a particular topic one of our members is interested in and thinks everyone else should be too (this could be you!), collaborative story-telling, or social games. We also hope to have an invited speaker, an author or expert.<br /><br />Q: What will you be doing this term?<br />A: We are still planning. Our first proper meeting of the year is always \"Desert Planet Books\" where we discuss what books we would want with us, should we get stranded on a desert planet, again. Come along to make the case for your favourite underrated book or just get some new recommendations. We also plan on playing \"Werewolf\", a party game about finding a murderous traitor within a group. We have our own version of the rules, carefully honed over many years, and now even have a prototype online app to allow us to play over Zoom.<br /><br />Q: Which authors will you have to speak?<br />A: We are still confirming a speaker for (probably) this term. In recent years, we have had Owen Cotton-Barratt (from the Future of Humanity Institute), Bradley P.

Every year our alumni go on to work for the most prestigious companies in finance, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley.<br />We run over 100 events every year and our term card is always full with an exciting programme of opportunities. Our workshops and interactive case studies give students hands-on finance experience and the chance to learn from industry professionals. We also host a number of presentations and networking events with our sponsor companies, allowing members to build meaningful connections within the industry.","FAQs":"Q: Is the society really completely free?<br />A: Yes! All of our talks, social events and career support are completely free and open to everyone.<br /><br />Q: I do not study economics/finance. Can I get involved?<br />A: Certainly! We have over 4,000 members across all subjects, from Oriental Studies and Classics to STEM. No knowledge of finance or economics is required at any of our talks.<br /><br />Q: I am applying for a Spring week or Summer internship. Can you help me?<br />A: Definitely, we have excellent links to leading employers in finance. In Michaelmas we always run numerous networking events and company presentations, too. In addition, there will be workshops with our members and alumni who interned with leading banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan or Bank of America and who will share their experiences. Last but not least, make sure to check our website for our Internship Booklet, which will guide you through the application process!<br /><br />Q: How do I get involved?<br />A: Alongside attending our events and signing up to the newsletter, the best way of being involved is by joining our college representative network. This gives you guaranteed free access to our Presidents' Drinks and other exciting social events. It is also an ideal way of getting familiar with our work and joining the OFS committee in later terms. You can talk to us about vacancies at any of our talks.<br /><br />Q: What are the Presidents' Drinks?<br />A: Presidents' Drinks are the highlight of every term: this super popular event brings students passionate about finance together in Oxford's premier bars, with drinks on us!<br /><br />Q: Will OFS keep running despite COVID-19?<br />A: Of course! We held a vastly successful series of virtual talks and insight days in Trinity Term, and we have even more ambitious plans for Michaelmas!

We think they're more interesting than consulting for larger companies, and gives everyone an opportunity to permanently improve how a small firm operates. <br /><br />Q: How much time does participation take? Is it worth the effort?<br />A: The average number of hours per week that being a student consultant at OCI takes is probably around 2. One hour for home research, and one hour for meeting up with the rest of your team. We think it is worth the effort! Especially if you're thinking about working for a consultancy in the future, or if you're interested in Entrepreneurship. <br /><br />Q: When do you meet?<br />A: Your meeting time will probably vary each week, to fit in with your busy schedules! The team leader will let you know when the next meeting will be, probably on a week-by-week basis.<br /><br />Q: Is it fun?<br />A: Yes! Working with startups is really fun- they're always led by such interesting, enthusiastic people.

So whether it be to meet a new group of people, or celebrate your cultural and religious roots, we hope to see you at our next event!","FAQs":"Q: What are our most popular events?<br />A: <br />Our two most popular annual events are the Diwali Ball and Holi.<br />The annual Diwali Ball is our most prolific event. Last year we transformed the Oxford Town Hall into a spectacle of lights, music, and culture. As well as musical entertainment, we had Bollywood-style photo booths, henna stalls, an abundance of food and… unlimited drinks and cocktails. All proceeds went to charity – we raised a total of £10,000 to support SNEHA, who work with communities to improve health outcomes of vulnerable women and children in India.<br />Our annual OxHoli event is Oxford’s biggest colour fight celebrating Holi, the Hindu Festival of Colour! Even though Holi is actually in March we hold our event in Trinity Term (May), when the weather is better. <br />Unfortunately we were not able to have these events this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. But we look forward to celebrating it we next can, and it will be even bigger, better and more colourful than last year’s.<br /><br />Q: What have we been doing during lockdown?<br />A:<br />Trinity Term last year was all virtual... so we had to do run our events a little differently. First up, we had our popular Big Fat Desi Quiz on Zoom, on all topics Desi ranging from Bollywood and cricket to religion and history. <br />We also had our first ever speaker series with talks on topics from politics, sustainability, Indian music and religion in collaboration with other societies - Oxford India Society (OIS) and South Asian Arts Society and Cambridge Uni Hindu Society. You can check them out on our YouTube channel... and we'll have more to come.<br />Because of the lockdown measures inevitably many of our events will the virtual again, but we're keen to hear suggestions from you so let us know at the Freshers fair or drop us a message on Facebook.<br /><br />Q: How can you follow our events and get involved?<br />A:<br />Make sure to follow us on Facebook and Instagram to stay up to date on what's happening or you can join our mailing list - we'll add you on at Freshers fair. You can always drop us a message if you have any questions or suggestions.<br />Our committee changes every year as well so you'll have a chance to run events, fundraise, give back to the community and more. Joining the team is a great way to make more Desi friends (who can be hard to come across particularly in Oxford!) and learn about the culture (and boost the CV a little too)."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Faith","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDaPAyQKpp0","emailSignupAddress":"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfL8lndgxoFPPUcTS-02wJO-31SUhzak-5WjQxlejGhlRZW9Q/viewform","facebookURL":"","ID":"55","instagramURL":"www.instagram.com/firstlovemk","logoFilename":"img/logos/55.jpg","name":"First Love Society","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NWVkODMxZTAtNDM1My00Y2M2LTk1MmYtYTdkYTg1M2FmMDkw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22b282aa5e-d617-4c8d-94f0-6299636fe88e%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"","description":"First Love is a Christian faith society with the motto 'Love God, Love others.' <br />Aims:<br />We aim to hold weekly meetings which will attract students from diverse backgrounds.

Founded in 2020, it was Oxford's first new newspaper in 30 years. It is now the university's largest student newspaper, with an editorial and business team that combined number almost 100 students from across the university and 600 students that are part of its contributing writers' group. The team is looking for submissions from students of all ages, regardless of past journalistic experience.","FAQs":"Q: What is The Oxford Blue? <br />A: The Oxford Blue is Oxford’s first independent student newspaper in over 30 years. We are also Oxford’s first digital-only news platform. You can find our content on our website at www.theoxfordblue.co.uk and across Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Spotify where you’ll find our articles, video interviews, podcasts and more! <br />Since The Blue’s conception in January 2020, we have published 800 articles by 280 writers ranging from Culture to Lifestyle and Global Affairs; had over 316k website views; been mentioned in the national and international press 30 times; been shortlisted for 3 awards and been translated into Hebrew, Spanish and Norwegian.<br />The paper was founded on an ethos of access and accountability, and as a disruptive new voice in Oxford we want to help students get involved with journalism regardless of their background or experience. Our team is made up of our talented and wonderfully promising writers, Editors and Business staff, all of whom are largely new to journalism. <br />In addition to our published content we also aim to provide insight into an industry that often feels imprentable and dominated by certain demographics through our events such as our journalism series where we talk to journalists from across the world to learn from their experiences and perspectives. <br /><br />Q: Why is there more than one student paper in Oxford? <br />A: The student journalism scene at Oxford is vibrant and diverse and we're one of three newspapers at the University. Each publication has its own culture, values and niche which means as a writer and reader you can find a space that fits your needs. <br />The Oxford Blue specifically is the first independent newspaper Oxford in 30 years, and the only news publication which creates exclusively digital content. Not only does this mean we break important stories quickly, but we're also able to use the most innovative technology in journalism to bring those stories to life.<br /><br />Q: How do I get involved with the Oxford Blue?<br />A: Become a writer by joining any of our contributors groups, which are open to all members of the Oxford community irrespective of whether you have past experience working in student journalism. Writers essentially work freelance - they can pick up commissions they fancy or they can pitch us their own ideas, but can do as little or as much as they want within that. Writers make our paper. Without them, we would not be able to publish the diverse and high quality content that we do: <br />You can join our writers groups here on Facebook: <br />Writers general group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2462003647260904<br />Culture: https://www.facebook.com/groups/462196064448438<br />Current Affairs: https://www.facebook.com/groups/193253081857146<br />Global Affairs: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2735233890043315<br />Lifestyle: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1769342386533026<br />Opinions: https://www.facebook.com/groups/624544481658740"},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Music","introVideoURL":"https://youtube.com/embed/-UzVaOawtW0","emailSignupAddress":"","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/OxfordUniversityBrassBand/","ID":"60","instagramURL":"https://instagram.com/oxforduniversitybrassband","logoFilename":"img/logos/60.jpg","name":"Oxford University Brass Band (OUBB)","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZTI3NDhhYjgtOGRiMS00YjYxLTgwZmYtNjE1YTc5OGJkNzgw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%226ef37e51-9e98-4282-82d3-30958360f656%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"http://oubrass.oums.org/","description":"OUBB is the University's official brass band.

At the moment, in-person concerts and full-band rehearsals are not possible. We may organise some online recorded performances, but these tend to be quite time-consuming so will not be possible during term time.

With the current restrictions, we'll move some events online, such as informal drinks, board games and speaker events; but we also plan to have some events exploring Oxford, which would definitely be offline. <br />Our term card will be uploaded at our website.<br /><br />Q: Are events only for members?<br />A: Events are open to everyone but non-members usually have a higher fee, while most are free for members. Termly membership costs £5, while yearly membership costs £10."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Music","introVideoURL":"","emailSignupAddress":"","facebookURL":"www.facebook.com/beatrootsacappella","ID":"62","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/62.png","name":"The Beatroots","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZjY2OGM2Y2QtNmZhMS00MWIxLThjZDYtZTA2NTgxMzk0YWUw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22684862c5-b2f2-4f8a-b428-a925e529e6c6%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"beatrootsacappella","websiteURL":"","description":"Mixed-voice contemporary a cappella group aimed at providing postgraduates, researchers, and university staff with an opportunity for close harmony.","FAQs":"Q: Do I need to be able to sight-sing?<br />A: No. A quick ear and enthusiasm to put in the extra time required can be just as good.<br /><br />Q: What's the time commitment like?<br />A: 2 hours once a week for rehearsals, and performances as and when we want.

What is Disarm Oxford?<br />A. Disarm Oxford is a new student activist group, which aims to cut the numerous ties between arms companies, and the central university, departments and colleges. We want to end research ties with arms companies, get the university to drop its weapons investments and quit advertising jobs and internships with them.<br /><br />Q. What can you say about these links exactly?<br />A. Within the last three years alone, the university has taken over £6 million from weapons producers Rolls Royce, and Oxford’s research grants active in 2019 include over £80 million paired with the MoD. The Physics department openly advertises undergraduate projects with the “Atomic Weapons Establishment” and weapons producers Airbus, while Drone Wars UK has produced a report on how the university is involved in the design of autonomous lethal weapons systems. Of the 67 current industrial partners for the Mathematics Department’s InFoMM CDT, at least 13 of these have links to arms companies or the UK/US military, and including logistical direct support for the ongoing bombing of Yemen.<br /><br />Q. How much of a time commitment would getting involved be and/or how could I help?<br />A. This is a new group, so there would be a wide variety of roles available for people to do (researching links further; social media, write-ups, peaceful direct action/protest organisation, pass motions through college common rooms/Oxford SU, etc...). Any level of commitment is fine; no one should feel under any obligation to do more than they want to or feel that they’re comfortable taking on."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Other","introVideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QZ8WGPRZeo","emailSignupAddress":"","facebookURL":"","ID":"68","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/68.png","name":"Oxford University Society of Change Ringers","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MDk3NDFhY2EtOTY1NC00ZWU3LTk1MzAtMTE2YmNkODEwMjg3%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%225e32c44b-e886-4bb9-8cc7-92695ca4603a%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"http://www.ouscr.org.uk","description":"We practice the traditional art of ringing church bells through-out Oxford city and further afield, with dedicated teaching sessions for beginners, regular practices and ringing to mark special occasions including Remembrance Day and May Day.

We are a unique institution, where some of the world’s most powerful, impressive figures share their most personal stories. Through speaker events, debates, panels and socials, the Union aims to bring something for everyone.<br /><br />Join in the debate<br />Historically, the Oxford Union has been part of some of the biggest and most important discussions that have shaped the world as we know it. From the debate of February 1933 which saw the chamber declare, by and overwhelming majority, that it would in no circumstances fight for king and country, to that of December 1964 in which Malcolm X delivered his famous speech on extremism in defence of liberty, it has always been at the forefront of international politics and global affairs. Becoming a member means engaging in this incredibly exciting, ever-changing discussion, and challenging your preconceptions.<br /><br /> <br />Listen to leaders make history<br />Be it world political visionaries, groundbreaking intellectuals, sporting stars, or Hollywood icons, the Oxford Union hosts leaders from every field, and holds events catered to all tastes. It’s probably the only place where you can have a drink with Elton John on one day, then challenge Marie Le Pen on her radical views the next. Whatever your interests, or degree field, it’s a place where you have the opportunity to meet and engage with your heroes, as well as learn about new and exciting things you might never have thought about before.<br /><br /> <br />Enjoy the Union's social scene<br />From the Members’ Bar to the Snooker Room, the Oxford Union is full of fabulous social spaces to hang out with friends and have fun. We boast some of the most affordable (and best) drinks in all of Oxford, and with weekly specials, it’s hard to find a better bar in Oxford. The bi-weekly pub quizzes are a firm favourite with members, and with cash prizes up for grabs, it’s not difficult to see why. The staff are friendly, and in the summer months, the courtyard outside is the perfect place to relax in the sun with a cool pint. The snooker room is also the only place in the whole of Oxford that you’ll be able to play on a traditional full size table!<br /><br /> <br />Get some quiet study time<br />If drinking and cue sports aren’t quite up your street, the Union buildings are also full of great study spaces for those days when essay deadlines are looming. From the beautiful Old Library, to the Gladstone and Goodman rooms, there are plenty of large tables and comfy leather armchairs to go around. Not only are the rooms beautiful, but they are full of historical relics, from the table on which William Gladstone held his cabinet meetings, to original William Morris wallpaper and Pre-Raphaelite murals. If you’re going to have an essay crisis, you may as well do so in magnificent surroundings.","FAQs":"Q: Why Join the Oxford Union?<br />A: A place at Oxford like no other. We are most famous for our weekly debates, where students are joined by top professionals and academics, ultimately being judged by you, and our speakers, every term we work to ensure that some of the world’s most influential people come and share their expertise. Beyond even that, our library provides a private space to study, and access to book sometimes unavailable in college libraries, and our bar together with our many events make us a brilliant place to socialise and unwind.<br /><br />Q: How can I Join?<br />A: You can purchase membership directly from our website (https://www.oxford-union.org/joining/join), or by visiting us at our premises. Please be sure to check whether you are eligible for Access Membership, or consider paying by instalments, as we are committed to extend the benefits of union membership to as many students as possible. <br /><br />Q: Who comes to speak to the Union?<br />A: What sets us apart from other societies is the calibre of speakers that we successfully attract every term. We have hosted visits from UK Prime Ministers including Theresa May – and David Cameron in the coming term - to US sitting Presidents Reagan, Nixon, and Carter, to celebrities such as Morgan Freeman, sporting legends like Diego Maradona, pioneers in science as Prof. Stephen Hawking, activists like Tarana Burke, and business leaders in Peter Thiel. You will be able to see all of these term’s speakers in our termcard, released online today and delivered to you on Thursday.<br /><br />Q: How is Covid affecting the Union?<br />A: Naturally we have had to change how we operate to adapt to this term. Our biggest loss will be the union ball, often a highlight of the term, though we hope to bring it back in Hilary. We are putting measures in place so that we can continue to provide the best possible experience to our members, including strict capacity limits on our in-person events, compulsory mask-wearing, hand santiser stations, temperature checks, and one-way systems. We currently plan on holding a mixture of in-person and online events, but are constantly weary of changing guidelines and best practices, and will continue to give more info closer to each event."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Music","introVideoURL":"","emailSignupAddress":"https://oxfordgregorianchant.blogspot.com/p/welcome.html","facebookURL":"","ID":"86","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/86.jpg","name":"Oxford Gregorian Chant Society (Schola Abelis)","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NTg1NDQ0YmEtY2YyYi00NzJkLTk0MTUtOGZjNjU4NWI4NWJl%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22414cbc3c-9cc2-4f86-bef6-51caa69e8ac4%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"","websiteURL":"https://oxfordgregorianchant.blogspot.com/","description":"We learn how to and sing Gregorian Chant in churches and chapels around Oxford and not only","FAQs":"Q: What do you sing, and when?<br />A: We sing Gregorian Chant, which is the ancient sacred music of Western Christianity.

This immersive approach, already used in ancient, medieval, and Renaissance schools, allows us to use the full language-learning potential of our brains to reach greater reading proficiency significantly faster, without sacrificing grammatical rigour. As a result, the method unlocks the study of the ancient texts in their original languages to a much wider audience than the traditional translation-based methods, which require years of intensive schooling.","FAQs":"Q: Why do you speak ancient Greek and Latin?<br />A: Speaking Greek and Latin, which is known as the 'direct method', is an effective and quick way of learning the ancient languages. Actively using Greek and Latin, indeed, draws us closer to how the ancients wrote and thought and enhances our reading fluency and comprehension.<br /><br />Q: Is the society open to everyone or only to classicists?<br />A: The society is open absolutely to everyone, not just to Classics students. Whether you already know Greek and Latin, have never studied them before or are already a fluent speaker, we'll be happy to have you with us!<br /><br />Q: Which events do you offer?<br />A: Our term cards are always extremely varied and exciting. After the international success of our intensive summer courses, this MT we're offering even more language classes than in past years, to accommodate students of all levels. Besides language classes, we also lead reading and discussion groups. In normal conditions, we also organise our beloved 'Noctes Musarum' for socialising, singing and conversation, and, about once every term, we hold a 'Dies Latinus', a study day entirely dedicated to one or more topics related to the ancient world. Each year, moreover, in Week 9th of HT, we organise a 'Septimana Latina', a week dedicated to speaking Greek and Latin, usually in Italy."},{"additionalPageURL":"","category":"Academic","introVideoURL":"","emailSignupAddress":"https://oxfordeconsoc.org/membership","facebookURL":"https://www.facebook.com/OxfordEconSoc","ID":"97","instagramURL":"","logoFilename":"img/logos/97.png","name":"Oxford Economics Society","teamsCallURL":"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MzhjMzkzNzQtODYyNy00MWZiLTkzZmUtNTVmMGIzNjJlZDZm%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22acf05977-6502-43c6-b879-79b8d33d56ed%22%7d","youtubeChannelURL":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8tThrdb4QUCZLjTgPeAYiQ/videos?fbclid=IwAR1GdzRLXu0058kRttU2_qT8J9rUyl4DMRcwr1N8aDreuPDTv3BHBfISYDI","websiteURL":"https://oxfordeconsoc.org","description":"We are open to all students of the University of Oxford, both in undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, and to students of Oxford Brookes University.
