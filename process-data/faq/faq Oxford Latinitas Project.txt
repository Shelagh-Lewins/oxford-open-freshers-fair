Q: Why do you speak ancient Greek and Latin?
A: Speaking Greek and Latin, which is known as the 'direct method', is an effective and quick way of learning the ancient languages. Actively using Greek and Latin, indeed, draws us closer to how the ancients wrote and thought and enhances our reading fluency and comprehension.

Q: Is the society open to everyone or only to classicists?
A: The society is open absolutely to everyone, not just to Classics students. Whether you already know Greek and Latin, have never studied them before or are already a fluent speaker, we'll be happy to have you with us!

Q: Which events do you offer?
A: Our term cards are always extremely varied and exciting. After the international success of our intensive summer courses, this MT we're offering even more language classes than in past years, to accommodate students of all levels. Besides language classes, we also lead reading and discussion groups. In normal conditions, we also organise our beloved 'Noctes Musarum' for socialising, singing and conversation, and, about once every term, we hold a 'Dies Latinus', a study day entirely dedicated to one or more topics related to the ancient world. Each year, moreover, in Week 9th of HT, we organise a 'Septimana Latina', a week dedicated to speaking Greek and Latin, usually in Italy.
