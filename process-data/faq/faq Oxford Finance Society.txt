Q: Is the society really completely free?
A: Yes! All of our talks, social events and career support are completely free and open to everyone.

Q: I do not study economics/finance. Can I get involved?
A: Certainly! We have over 4,000 members across all subjects, from Oriental Studies and Classics to STEM. No knowledge of finance or economics is required at any of our talks.

Q: I am applying for a Spring week or Summer internship. Can you help me?
A: Definitely, we have excellent links to leading employers in finance. In Michaelmas we always run numerous networking events and company presentations, too. In addition, there will be workshops with our members and alumni who interned with leading banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan or Bank of America and who will share their experiences. Last but not least, make sure to check our website for our Internship Booklet, which will guide you through the application process!

Q: How do I get involved?
A: Alongside attending our events and signing up to the newsletter, the best way of being involved is by joining our college representative network. This gives you guaranteed free access to our Presidents' Drinks and other exciting social events. It is also an ideal way of getting familiar with our work and joining the OFS committee in later terms. You can talk to us about vacancies at any of our talks.

Q: What are the Presidents' Drinks?
A: Presidents' Drinks are the highlight of every term: this super popular event brings students passionate about finance together in Oxford's premier bars, with drinks on us!

Q: Will OFS keep running despite COVID-19?
A: Of course! We held a vastly successful series of virtual talks and insight days in Trinity Term, and we have even more ambitious plans for Michaelmas! Follow us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/oxfordfinancesociety) and sign up to our newsletter to learn more!
