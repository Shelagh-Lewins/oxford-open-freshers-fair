TEDxOxford celebrates TED's mission of "ideas worth spreading" by bringing conferences to local communities within Oxford. Our society organizes a full day conference annually, inviting speakers from all walks of life that represent the evolving intellectual landscape of our society. This year, we've planned to do an online conference, hoping to increase accessibility to the event by making our talks free of charge and reaching out to a global audience.
