Q: Do you need to be Libertarian?
A: No, the vast majority of members aren't Libertarian. There's no clear political bias to the group, and we'd be more than excited to welcome anyone with new ideas.

Q: Is there an attendance and/or membership fee?
A: Basically, no. We don't think we can justify event fees while online (we have never run a profit, and never will), and membership has always been free, and looks like it will stay that way. There are a couple prerequisites, but none of them are financial. 

Q: Are you anything to do with Oxford Students for Life?
A: No, but once a girl did join our chat by mistake, when looking for them. We only share an acronym (we are Oxford Students for Liberty).

Q: Can I see a review that's ten years out of date?
A: Sure. https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2010/11/04/sochopping-oxford-students-for-liberty/
