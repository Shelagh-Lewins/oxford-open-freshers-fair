Q: What is CapitOx?
A: CapitOx is Oxford's Premier Finance & Consulting society with a 12 year history in Oxford. If your goal is to someday work in the city in the Finance or Consulting fields; then we make it our mission to ensure your dream becomes a reality. We host workshops, panel speakers, networking events, all for you to meet the people, gain the skills and knowledge for securing your dream career. Don't be scared into thinking our committee is full of Wolf of Wall Street wannabes... we're pretty friendly! :)

Q: I don't do economics/I know nothing about Finance or Consulting - is CapitOx for me?
A: Finance and consulting careers are one of the most popular and lucrative career choices for Oxford graduates (and for good reason!). It is well worth being open and considering if you are interested in pursuing a career that is becoming more accessible by the day. We understand a lot of our members won't have finance/consulting experience or knowledge and this is okay! We offer training on our consulting programme and we start from no prior knowledge on our finance academy. There really is no excuse to see if this is the career for you!
