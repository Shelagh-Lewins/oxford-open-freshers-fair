What is OUES about?
Oxford University English Society is a friendly community with regular, interesting and fun events to create a sense community amongst English students and literature lovers throughout the whole University, whatever their degree! Through all the events you get to meet lots of new and interesting people outside your college and subject. The society allows lots of intellectual discussion on topics outside of your degree course. Through collaboration with other societies we’ve had careers events in which allow you to learn more about careers connected to Literature.

What does OUES offer beyond a what Literature degree can provide?
English degrees here at Oxford are great fun and really interesting but like most humanities courses teaching is mainly done in college so attending the English Society events is a great way to meet lots of interesting people from other colleges who are interested in literature. Also you don't have to study English to join the society or attend its events- we've had computer scientists, lawyers, biologists, geographers, historians, classicists and people from many more subjects enjoy our events.

What sort of events have you put on in the past?
•Intellectual events such as lectures, Prelims advice sessions etc. 
•Social events such as drinks and nibbles, ‘Woolf and Burns Birthday Bash’ party, film nights, pub quizzes, poetry open mic nights
•Collaborations with other societies have included ticket discount offers for certain student plays, careers focused events in collaboration with other societies
