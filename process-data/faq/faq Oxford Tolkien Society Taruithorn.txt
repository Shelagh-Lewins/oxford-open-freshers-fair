Q: Who can join the society? 
A: Everyone is welcome, from those who have read the Silmarillion multiple times, to those who have just seen the films, or maybe only have a budding interest in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. Taruithorn has no entry requirements: we simply want people to come along and have fun - if you happen to learn something new about Tolkien along the way, all the better!

Q: What are the common events? 
A: In Michaelmas - The Freshers' Moot drinks evening, a Tolkien's Oxford tour, a Trial (or, more recently, Eagle’s Debate), and the Gandalf's Fireworks party.
In Hilary - Most of the events focus on preparation for the Varsity Quiz against our counterparts in Cambridge, Minas Tirith, or our biggest annual event, the Society Banquet.
In Trinity - A large variety of outdoors events, including outdoor games, the Golfimbul BBQ, the Strawberry Party, and plenty of punting.
General meetings throughout the year include video meetings, crafts events, dramatic readings, or games evenings.

Q: What’s happening this Michaelmas?
A: Due to social distancing rules, most events this term will be adapted to digital formats, apart from outdoor events such as our walking tour, if circumstances allow. For complete termcard see our website (http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tolksoc/).
