The Oxford Consulting Initiative (OCI) is Oxford's only student consultancy working exclusively with startups. We work closely with our clients to help them achieve their goals and deliver impactful results.
Teams of students meet regularly and communicate closely with the client, ensuring our projects are successful and tailored to their needs.
Alongside our projects, we also run several skills events with consulting firms including interview and case study workshops focused on helping with internship and job applications.
