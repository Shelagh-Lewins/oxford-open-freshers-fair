We are a new group, campaigning against Oxford University's ties with the arms trade. These ties include funding, research projects, building sponsorships, careers events, and more. Beginning this year, we plan to communicate to the University through motions, investigative reporting, and direct action that this complicity in destruction and suffering is not acceptable.
