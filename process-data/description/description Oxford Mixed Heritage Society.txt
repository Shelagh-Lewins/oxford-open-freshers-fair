Founded in 2018, we believe we are the UK's first society for mixed race students! We aim to create an inclusive space where Mixed Heritage students can explore their racial identity and build a network with other mixed heritage students. 
We run weekly events that bring Oxfordâ€™s mixed heritage community together such as termly mixer social events, multicultural film nights, hosting mixed-heritage speakers and focus groups to create conversions around mixed identity, and participating in nationwide movements, such as Metro's 'Mixed Up' series and the Mixed Race Faces photo campaign.
We are passionate about supporting mixed-heritage success, celebrating the richness of different cultures, and raising the profile of minority ethnicities at the University of Oxford and in the wider community.
