Set up in 2018, Oxford South Asian Society is a student-led society at the University of Oxford with the aim to discuss and deliberate on possible solutions for issues of political, legal and social significance for the South Asian region, and to celebrate the cultural diversity of the region. In addition to organizing informal discussions and socials for members of the society, we regularly host academics, activists and policy-makers from the region to understand how one can foster cooperation among South Asian countries. In the past, we have had the pleasure of hosting the likes of Ms Kavita Krishnan, Mr Prithviraj Chavan, Ms Arfa Khanun Sherwani from India; Dr Ayesha Siddiqa, Mr Mohsin Dawar, Mr Ziauddin Yousafzai from Pakistan; Mr Naveed Noormal from Afghanistan; Ms Dilrukshi Handunnetti and Mr Aritha Wickramasinghe from Sri Lanka, among others. Join for insightful conversations over chai!
