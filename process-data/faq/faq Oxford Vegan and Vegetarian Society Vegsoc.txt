Q: What kind of events do you do?
A: We put on loads of fun events that fall into two main categories. We do social events which let students meet up and get to know like-minded students, usually over some food, and we do education & outreach events like talks, panels, discussions, and more unconventional outreach like giveaways and fun stuff like that. Some example events we’ve had in the past are Christmas vegan cookie decorating, a talk from speaker and activist Earthling Ed, and we even had an event in Radcliffe Square where we gave away 700 vegan sandwiches! Obviously, the current situation means these in-person events are not always possible, but we’re working on innovative ways to make the society work online and safely in person.

Q: What's the best way to get involved?

A: Like us on Facebook, follow us on Instagram, and join our mailing list! You'll be informed of all the events we put on, and kept abreast of Vegsoc news. If you're interested in helping run Vegsoc, chat with one of our committee members about how to get involved with that - we're recruiting for our 2020-21 committee and for College Vegsoc Reps!

Q: Can I join in if I’m vegetarian/pescetarian/reducetarian/omnivore/eat meat at home/anything else?
A: YES! We welcome people of all diets; it’s not exclusive to vegans; come along to any event if you are interested or think it sounds fun.
