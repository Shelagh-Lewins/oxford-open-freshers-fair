Q: How often do you launch rockets?
A: We have typically launched about one big rocket per year, but we have some plans in the works to also launch some smaller rockets more often.

Q: What kind of rockets do you launch?
A: We are all about innovation and improvement, so we are always looking for novel ideas. We are currently working on 2 rockets, one that will use a hybrid rocket engine, and one that will use vectored thrust instead of fins.

Q: How much experience do I need to join?
A: None! We have a motto in our society: Enthusiasm required, experience provided. Most of us had never even seen a rocket in real life before we joined, but over time we all learnt the ins and outs of model rocket building!
