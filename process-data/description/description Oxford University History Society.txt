Oxford University History Society is a vibrant, wide ranging student-society, encompassing the second largest subject group in Oxford alongside thousands of students for whom history forms some facet of their course.
Most events - like our guest lectures, social events, and society cocktails - are open to absolutely anybody so long as you are a registered member or you pay the non-members entry fee. Those on our mailing list will receive regular emails reminding you of upcoming events and keeping you informed about society affairs. Alternatively, you can visit our Facebook page or take a look at our online Termcard. 
Our previous speakers have included Peter Frankopan, the author of bestseller Silk Roads; Dan Snow, noted BBC Presenter; and Lissant Bolton, the Keeper for the British Museum’s Africa, Oceania and Americas Department. In addition, through panels, we have explored a wide-ranging selection of topics from gender’s role in the study of history, to the need for a Black History Month. OUHS also organises social events every term; past examples of such events include Society Cocktails, Presidents Drinks, and the termly Pub Quiz. 
Membership is available to any member of the University of Oxford or of Ruskin College, Plater College, Ripon College, Cuddesdon, Wycliffe Hall or St. Stephen's House. Any member of any other educational institution in Oxford or a resident of the City of Oxford is also eligible, so long as they pay the membership fee. Lifetime membership can be purchased on the door at any of our events for £15.
