Oxford University Student Chorus is the University's largest non-auditioning choir. Numbering around 70 singers, we are committed to bringing together both experienced and first-time singers from all parts of the University and with any (or no) musical background, through the performance of larger scale choral works. Recent concerts have included Dvorak's Stabat Mater and Schumann's Das Paradies und die Peri. The Chorus performs at venues across the city, including the Town Hall, Sheldonian Theatre, the University Church and various College Chapels.
