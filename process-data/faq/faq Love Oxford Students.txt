Q: What is Love Oxford Students
A: Love Oxford Students is a society that exists to help love Oxford students well by helping them connect up with churches in Oxford or bringing them to a church is they've never been.

Q: Isn't church irrelevant to me if I'm not a Christian?
A: Definitely not! Anyone can go to church. We think churches can often be some of the most welcoming and friendly places in Oxford. In fact, church can be a great place to find friends and ask some of life's biggest questions.

Q: Can I go to church if I've never been before?
A: Yes! Of course. We think that everyone should try church at least once while in Oxford. There are so many great churches in Oxford and we would love to connect you up with a student who could take you out for a coffee before heading to a church.
