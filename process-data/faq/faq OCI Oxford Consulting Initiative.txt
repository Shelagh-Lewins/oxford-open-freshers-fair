Q: Why does Oxford need another consulting society?
A: OCI specialises in consulting for startups. We think they're more interesting than consulting for larger companies, and gives everyone an opportunity to permanently improve how a small firm operates. 

Q: How much time does participation take? Is it worth the effort?
A: The average number of hours per week that being a student consultant at OCI takes is probably around 2. One hour for home research, and one hour for meeting up with the rest of your team. We think it is worth the effort! Especially if you're thinking about working for a consultancy in the future, or if you're interested in Entrepreneurship. 

Q: When do you meet?
A: Your meeting time will probably vary each week, to fit in with your busy schedules! The team leader will let you know when the next meeting will be, probably on a week-by-week basis.

Q: Is it fun?
A: Yes! Working with startups is really fun- they're always led by such interesting, enthusiastic people. More than 90% of our student consultants stick with OCI's program from the beginning of Michaelmas to the end of Hilary.
