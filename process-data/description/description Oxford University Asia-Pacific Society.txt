The Oxford University Asia-Pacific Society (OUAPS) is a student-run organisation which promotes and celebrates the cultures of Asia-Pacific countries and aims to connect students from the Asia-Pacific and beyond. We host a range of corporate, cultural, and social events each year, from our annual sold out Boat Party, to food fairs, to termly drinks, socials, and dinners. Founded in 1999, OUAPS has since grown to become one of the largest societies in Oxford and has earned a reputation for hosting some of Oxfordâ€™s largest and most anticipated social events.
