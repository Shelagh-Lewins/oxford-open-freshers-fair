Q: What is Roundnet (aka Spikeball)?
A: Roundnet is a 360° game played in two teams of 2v2, with a circular net in-between the teams. A player starts a point by serving the ball down on the net so it ricochets up at their opponent. They have up to three hits between them (just like Volleyball) to control the ball and bounce it back off the net.

Q: Do I need any experience to play?
A: Absolutely none! We expect no one to have heard of the sport before, so come give it a go! 

Q: Do I need to bring anything?
A: All you have to bring is a friend or two for your team and your competitive but friendly spirit! All equipment will be provided for you.

Q: Is the sport mixed gender?
A: Of course, in fact we encourage everyone to get involved!

Q: How much is membership?
A: Membership for the year will only cost £15, which is cheaper than almost all Roundnet societies in the UK (we decided to make this cheaper as we recognise most people will have never heard of Roundnet before). This  includes a subsided fee for entry to tournaments, and free access to all equipment for the year.
