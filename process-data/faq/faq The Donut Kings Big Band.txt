Q: When do you perform? 
A: Donut Kings perform regularly throughout the university term. Most often, we perform at Jazz at St Giles, a jazz series held at St Giles Church, at college balls and society events, and concerts. 

Q: What sort of repertoire do you perform?
A: Donut Kings play a wide range of both traditional and more modern big band music. Some of our more classic repertoire choices include music by Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, whilst some of our more modern choices include music by Phil Collins Big Band and Don Ellis.  

Q: Are band members paid for their appearance in concerts?
A: Unfortunately not; Donut Kings, as a band, receive a payment from ticket sales or hiring, but that money goes towards the upkeep of the band. 

Q: Is there opportunity to get involved with committee roles in the band? 
A: Absolutely! The committee currently consists of a Musical Director, President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Social Secretary. We welcome any interest in these roles.
