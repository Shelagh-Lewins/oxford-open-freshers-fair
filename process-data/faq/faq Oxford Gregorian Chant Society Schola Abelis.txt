Q: What do you sing, and when?
A: We sing Gregorian Chant, which is the ancient sacred music of Western Christianity. We sing it in the context for which it was composed, the traditional Roman Catholic liturgy.

Q: Who can join? Are singers paid?
A: It is an all-male schola; we accept those of all faiths and none, if you can pitch a note! Student singers are paid a Â£15 stipend per event.

Q: What is the time committment?
A: As a rule we rehearse only on the day, an hour or less before the performance. We usually have four or five events a term. You can sing at some and not others.
