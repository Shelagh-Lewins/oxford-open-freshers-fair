Q: What is Oxford International Society's goal?
A: We strive to host events where international students feel comfortable and safe. We structure our events so they are as relaxed and sociable as possible, where one can meet lots of new people and make new friends.
Q: What events does Oxford International Society usually host? 
A: During most terms we host picnics in the park, trips for ice cream and teas. We hosted a Chinese New Year dinner in 2019 and are looking to host more dinners sometime in the future. During the online Trinity Term we also hosted online hangouts on Zoom!

Q: How can I find out more about what's happening/events going on?
A: We have both an Oxford International Society page and an Oxford International Society group on Facebook. Like the page and join the group to receive up to date news about future events!
