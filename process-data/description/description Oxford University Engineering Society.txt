The Oxford University Engineering Society (OUEngSoc) was established in 1998, and has grown to become one of the largest societies within the university. OUEngSoc seeks to link our members with industry leaders to form long-lasting connections and to equip our members with the skills and knowledge required to access career paths they are passionate about. Our members pay a one-time fee of Â£10 to access all society events, including socials, formal dinners, speaker and panel events, workshops and more.
