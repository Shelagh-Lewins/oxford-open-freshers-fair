The OUCSS brings together Czech and Slovak students at the University of Oxford, regardless of their major or age. We organise various events of both educational and social character to give our members a chance to meet up, chat, learn and maintain the Czech and Slovak culture outside of our countries. We have hosted talks with many inspiring people from the Czech and Slovak Republic, including Michal Horáček and Bohdan Pomahač, and there are many more exciting talks to come. We have organised social events with other societies to expand the cultural experience. In the upcoming term, we are planning to continue running all these activities, and even add some brand-new ones. It will be our pleasure to welcome our new and our current members at all of these events.
