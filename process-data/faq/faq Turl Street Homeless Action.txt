Q: How do I get involved?
All you need to do to get involved is join our Facebook group (facebook.com/groups/turlstreethomelessaction) and sign up for a shift on the Google Sheet in the pinned post. It's as simple as that!

Q: Do I need training to volunteer with TSHA?
You don't need training to volunteer on a shift. If you want to lead a shift, which involves coordinating the shift and preparing everything beforehand, it's advised you have a bit of training that we do once a term or so. But for first-time volunteers, don't worry!

Q: What steps are you taking to ensure everyone is safe in light of COVID-19?
We are currently looking into organisations we can partner with to deliver hot food that is prepared hygienically. We will be asking people to wear masks on shift and are looking into whether we can provide spare PPE to students as well as packs to give out to rough sleepers.
