Oxford Turl Street orchestra is the largest non-auditioning orchestra in Oxford. We have weekly rehearsals and usually one concert per term, even though this might look slightly different this year due to the pandemic.
Our repertoire covers mostly classic and romantic  classical music (Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Chopin, Grieg ... ). As we do not have auditions, everyone playing an orchestral instrument is welcome to play with us. We aim at a high standard of orchestral playing but our primary focus is on making music together and having a good time - no pressure. Our rehearsals traditionally include a biscuit break ;)
