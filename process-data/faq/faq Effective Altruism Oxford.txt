Q: How can I get involved?
A: Join our Facebook group and mailing list, sign up to our Introductory Fellowship, or come along to our intro talk (on the 7th of October). 

Q: What sort of work do you do?
A: EA Oxford focuses on learning tools to have the most impact after we graduate. We run discussion groups and planning sessions for students, and introduce them to relevant professionals in fields they're interested in.

Q: I've heard a bit about EA before. Should I still get involved in the same way?
A: If you book a chat with a committee member we could give you more specific recommendations.

Q: I have some more questions about the society and Effective Altruism. Who should I ask?
A: You could talk to us at our freshers' fair stall, arrange a 1-1 with us, or email us at info.eaoxford@gmail.com
