Q. What is Disarm Oxford?
A. Disarm Oxford is a new student activist group, which aims to cut the numerous ties between arms companies, and the central university, departments and colleges. We want to end research ties with arms companies, get the university to drop its weapons investments and quit advertising jobs and internships with them.

Q. What can you say about these links exactly?
A. Within the last three years alone, the university has taken over £6 million from weapons producers Rolls Royce, and Oxford’s research grants active in 2019 include over £80 million paired with the MoD. The Physics department openly advertises undergraduate projects with the “Atomic Weapons Establishment” and weapons producers Airbus, while Drone Wars UK has produced a report on how the university is involved in the design of autonomous lethal weapons systems. Of the 67 current industrial partners for the Mathematics Department’s InFoMM CDT, at least 13 of these have links to arms companies or the UK/US military, and including logistical direct support for the ongoing bombing of Yemen.

Q. How much of a time commitment would getting involved be and/or how could I help?
A. This is a new group, so there would be a wide variety of roles available for people to do (researching links further; social media, write-ups, peaceful direct action/protest organisation, pass motions through college common rooms/Oxford SU, etc...). Any level of commitment is fine; no one should feel under any obligation to do more than they want to or feel that they’re comfortable taking on.
