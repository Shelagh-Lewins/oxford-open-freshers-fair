We exist because we believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity to take part in community-based social and recreational activities, make friends, and be included fully and equally in society. KEEN is about creating, supporting, and promoting fantastic opportunities for everyone, but particularly children and adults with a learning/physical disability, or additional needs.
