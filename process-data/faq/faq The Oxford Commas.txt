Q: What kind of music do you sing?
A: We normally sing a variety of pop and jazz music, though have ventured into more diverse genres such as Barbershop, Musical Theatre and many more. Everything we do is group-led!
 
Q: How often do you rehearse?
A: Around twice a week for between 2-3 hours, though exact timings will be set once the group for the year is formed.

Q: What's it like singing in the Commas?
A: So much fun! What makes the Commas unique is our focus on really good sound quality; we absolutely put the music first, but never at the expense of having a really good time as a group.

Q: Where do you perform? 
A: Anywhere from College Balls, to our own concerts and concerts joint with other groups. We're also always looking to expand our presence through digital media, whether its live sessions, audio recordings etc.

Q: Is there anything in particular you're looking for in auditionees?
A: Just anyone who has a real enjoyment of music - we're excited to hear all voice parts audition. Special talents always very welcome, we can always use arrangers, beatboxers etc.

Q: How will you be dealing with the ongoing Covid-19 situation?
A: Obviously everything is continually changing, but at the moment our plan is to focus primarily on digital media in lieu of live performances - though we'll leap on any opportunity to perform in a Covid-safe way. In terms of the 'rule of six' we're aiming to be creative with our rehearsal schedule to allow for more sub-groups which can work more closely on sectionals or smaller arrangements, e.g. Barbershop.
