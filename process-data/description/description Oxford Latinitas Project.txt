The Oxford Latinitas Project is a group of students and dons, primarily from the University of Oxford, working to promote the studies of Latin and Greek among people of all backgrounds by developing and applying cutting-edge pedagogical techniques based on the direct method, i.e. not just reading and writing, but also speaking and listening. This immersive approach, already used in ancient, medieval, and Renaissance schools, allows us to use the full language-learning potential of our brains to reach greater reading proficiency significantly faster, without sacrificing grammatical rigour. As a result, the method unlocks the study of the ancient texts in their original languages to a much wider audience than the traditional translation-based methods, which require years of intensive schooling.
