The Oxford Longevity Society aims to foster insightful discussion surrounding scientific breakthroughs in aging and longevity. The society bridges the gap between an often inaccessible field of biogerontological research, and inquisitive Oxford minds curious about life extension. We host talks and discussions on the ethics and science of longevity and anti-aging technology.
