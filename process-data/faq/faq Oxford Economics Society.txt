Q: What do you do in your society? 
A: Members are able to discuss their ideas with speakers and among themselves in an informal setting, developing insights into topics that matter, from the economics of climate change to the role of biases in decision-making and economic models. This term, we will be hosting our events online through our Facebook page and YouTube channel, while maintaining a degree of interaction with viewers by allowing for questions to be raised at the end. 

Q: Who can join the society? 
A: We are open to all students of the University of Oxford, both in undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, and to students of Oxford Brookes University.

Q: How do I know when you will be hosting speaker events?
