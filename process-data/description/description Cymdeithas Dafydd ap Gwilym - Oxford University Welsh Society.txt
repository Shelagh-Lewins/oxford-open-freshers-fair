Cymdeithas Dafydd ap Gwilym (Y Dafydd) is the Welsh society at the University of Oxford. Founded in 1886, it is the oldest affiliated student society to the University. It aims to be a place for all Welsh students to celebrate Welsh culture, and welcomes all who wish to learn more about Wales! Y Dafydd is open to everyone - whether you're a native Welsh speaker, or you don't live in Wales at all but love its language and are interested in its culture, and everything in between.
