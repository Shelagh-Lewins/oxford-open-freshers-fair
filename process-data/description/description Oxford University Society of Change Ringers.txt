We practice the traditional art of ringing church bells through-out Oxford city and further afield, with dedicated teaching sessions for beginners, regular practices and ringing to mark special occasions including Remembrance Day and May Day. We also organise numerous socials and outings throughout the year, including joint outings with other university societies.
