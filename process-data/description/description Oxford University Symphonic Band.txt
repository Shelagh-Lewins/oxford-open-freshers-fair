Oxford University Symphonic Band (OUSB) is a non-auditioning wind band that plays classical and film music. We are a casual ensemble and primarily focus on playing for fun in a relaxed environment. Rehearsals are usually on Monday evenings from 7 until 9 pm and we put on a concert at the end of each term.
