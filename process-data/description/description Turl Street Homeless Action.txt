Turl Street Homeless Action (TSHA) organises nightly runs of sandwiches, snacks, and hot drinks to rough sleepers in Oxford. We usually run two shifts leaving from central colleges at about 7pm every evening, with the level of commitment you want to put in completely up to you. We are a completely student-run and secular organisation, and anyone is completely welcome to help out by just joining our Facebook group and signing up to the rota.
