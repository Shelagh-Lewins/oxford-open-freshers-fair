Oxford Climate Society is one of the world's largest student-run climate societies and one of the largest societies within Oxford University. Our aim is to develop the next generation of informed climate leaders. We run weekly events with world leading environmental thinkers such as Patricia Espinosa (Head of UN Climate Change), Mary Robinson (Former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights) and Jim Skea (Co-chair of Working Group 3 of the IPCC). We also run an award-winning seminar programme, the School of Climate Change, as well as the worldâ€™s largest student-led climate journal, Anthroposphere. We are also run campaigns, workshops and are working with the university to develop net-zero policies and incorporate climate change into the Oxford curriculum.
