We play various assassins themed games, which involve having to kill players from other teams by hitting them with thrown knives (pens actually), shooting them with (nerf) guns, slashing them with (fake) swords, setting traps for them or one of several other methods.

The usual week long games also have daily events such as king of the hill, melee only fights or whatever else the umpire thinks of. Finally, they culminate in an *epic* large scale event played in University Parks.

We also hold several yearly themed games with different mechanics such as Pirate Punting and Zombies. We've also held several online games since COVID started and we plan to continue doing that too.
