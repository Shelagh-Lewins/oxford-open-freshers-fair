Effective Altruism Oxford wants to give every Oxford student the opportunity to have a huge positive impact on the world.
To do this we create opportunities for students to learn about the worldâ€™s most pressing problems and how to use their careers to help solve them.
We are a friendly community of people interested in helping others, and part of the global Effective Altruism network.
