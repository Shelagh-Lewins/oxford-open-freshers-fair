Q: How will the events be run this term?
A: For Michaelmas and potentially the rest of the year we will be running most events online using Microsoft Teams. If we do run any events in person (at most one or two this term) they will always be outside and designed to easily follow social distancing guidelines.

Q: How much are memberships and events?
A: Free for at least as long as we are aren't having in person events. Membership in a normal year is £11 for the year and most events are free for members and typically cost £1-£3 for non-members.

Q: And most importantly, are there snacks at in person events?
A: Yes there are snacks and we try to have a variety of choices to try and cater to various dietary requirements.

Q: (On request of our Quibbler Editor) Where can I post all my fan-fics and essays I've been desperately writing throughout lockdown?
A: We will happily accept any submissions and will post them either anonymously or named on our website and facebook group. (https://www.ouhpsoc.org/news)
