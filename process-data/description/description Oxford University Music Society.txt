The Oxford University Music Society was founded in 1872, making it one of Oxford’s oldest and most prestigious societies. It was founded to promote the appreciation and performance of music within the University. For the last 140 years we have been a central focus for Oxford’s rich musical life, for students, academics, and members of the Oxford public. Being a member of OUMS does not necessarily mean that you are performer, but that you enjoy music in some form or another.
OUMS aims to encourage mass participation in music. As well as co-ordinating many auditioned ensembles, including the flagship Oxford University Orchestra, the society runs  many non-auditioning ensemble. In addition, OUMS is looking to play a big part in improving and increasing the provision of college music so that everyone, whatever their skill, can get involved.
OUMS also aims to be the hub of music for anyone in Oxford. As well as orchestrating the majority of Oxford’s student concerts, we also provide a weekly events newsletter during term time to all our registered members. There is no membership fee or regular commitment, so don’t hesitate to get involved in music at Oxford!
