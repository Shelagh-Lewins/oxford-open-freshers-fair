Our mission is to provide trustworthy university application advice that we wish we'd had. Figuring out university applications whilst studying is a pain. Itâ€™s unfair that some people have to do this alone, and others have help. That's why we aim to offer concise, reliable information from recent or current students. Join our community and support a website viewed by over 23,000 people in 190+ countries. Help make admissions fairer.
