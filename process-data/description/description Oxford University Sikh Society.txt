Oxford Sikh Society aims to represent Sikhs in Oxford and bring together the community from across the university and city. We host social events, work with organisations to carry out ‘seva’ (selfless service), and aim to promote visibility of Sikhi in the university. Our main aim is to ensure Sikh students are aware of the existing community of Sikhs in the university, and feel at home during their time here.
