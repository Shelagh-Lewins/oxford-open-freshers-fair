The Oxford Blue is an online newspaper produced entirely by students at the University of Oxford. Founded in 2020, it was Oxford's first new newspaper in 30 years. It is now the university's largest student newspaper, with an editorial and business team that combined number almost 100 students from across the university and 600 students that are part of its contributing writers' group. The team is looking for submissions from students of all ages, regardless of past journalistic experience.
