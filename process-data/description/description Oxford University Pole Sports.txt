Whether you're brand new to pole or an experienced pole competitor, OU Pole Sports is a fun and supportive place to train, learn new skills, and join the Oxford University pole family.
We run a schedule of classes weekly, enter a competition team into university-level pole competitions annually & perform at balls and bops.
