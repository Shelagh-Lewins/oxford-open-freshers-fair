HUMSoc (Oxford University Hindu Society) hosts social and cultural events with a Hindu and Asian theme for the student population of Oxford.
We have something to offer to everyone regardless of faith and background – from the annual Diwali Ball to the weekly Aarti, from the highly anticipated OxHoli to Bollywood movie nights, HUM is where it’s at!
Our events continue to attract a diverse range of students as we aim to share all things Desi with the Oxford community. So whether it be to meet a new group of people, or celebrate your cultural and religious roots, we hope to see you at our next event!
