Q: What does OUCA do?
A: OUCA is most well-known for Port and Policy, the weekly social and debating event which we host every Sunday evening of term. Our popular and regular socials include pub trips, poker nights, quizzes, parties, ice skating, punting, and a Termly Dinner every 8th week. We also organise a range of other activities, including charity work in Oxford, and speaker events with politicians, journalists, or other public figures.

Q: How do I become a member?
A: You can buy membership at any of our events, or at https://www.ouconservatives.com/join.

Q: How involved is OUCA with the Conservative Party?
A: We aren't officially affiliated with the Party - we are a broadchurch conservative society, and host a variety of right-wing speakers, most of whom belong to the Party, but some of whom don't. We always offer support to Conservative Party candidates, whether they are campaigning for seats in Oxford or around the country, and run frequent campaign days to get canvassing experience.

Q: I'm not a Conservative voter - am I still welcome to OUCA events?
A: Of course! Our events and talks are open to any and all, regardless of membership, and we welcome students of all political views or none. We recommend that everyone tries P&P once, no matter their political persuasion, to argue their views and take part in the debate.

Q: I'm interested in joining the OUCA committee - how do I get involved?
A: We run elections at the end of each term, where the next term's committee will be elected. If you are interested in running for election, please get in touch with the Returning Officer at returningofficer@ouconservatives.co.uk. All election rules can be found on our website, and we encourage any interested members to get involved.
