Q: What is the audition process like this year?
A: In order to keep auditions safe and accessible we have decided to hold all our auditions online in 0th week. In the first round, we will ask you to submit a video of a prepared piece and if you're invited back to the second round of auditions you'll sing an unaccompanied folk song and have a sight singing test. You will meet the Chair, Conductor, and Conducting Scholar who can answer any questions you have too!

Q: How often do you meet?
A: We meet once a week on a Monday evening.

Q: Are there any extra opportunities other than concerts?
A: We are an internationally renowned choir, and so are often invited abroad to sing and tour globally. In addition, many of our alumni are distinguished professional singers and come back to give masterclasses. For example, last term Dame Emma Kirkby gave our singers one-on-one masterclasses in Queen's College Chapel.
