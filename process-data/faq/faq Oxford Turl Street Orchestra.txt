A: We usually play classical music from the Romantic and Classical period. In the past, we have played orchestral pieces by Schubert, Beethoven, Grieg, Chopin, Mozart. Some examples are: Schubert's unfinished symphony, Grieg's piano concerto, Beethoven Symphony No.7

Q: Which instruments are you looking for? 
A: Our members normally play standard orchestral instruments (clarinet, flute, oboe, Frenchhorn, doublebass, cello, viola, violin, trumpet, trombone) but we are willing to try to accommodate for less conventional instruments and find appropriate repertoire. 

Q: How regularly do you rehearse? 
A: We rehearse once per week. 

Q: How many concerts do you have? 
A: We usually aim at one concert per term 

Q: Which level do I need to play with you? 
A: As we are a non-auditioning orchestra, everyone is weclome to come along and see for themselves whether they are comfortabel with the level of playing in the orchestra. Even though musical quality is very important to us, our primary goal os to have fun together in a relaxed atmosphere. Understandably, some experience with playing in an orchestra or ensemble is always a plus but everyone is welcome to come along and see for themselves. You can always stop if you feel like it is not what you were looking for. 

Q: How will COVID affect your rehearsals? 
A: As things stand now, we do not know yet where and with how many people we will be able to rehearse and whether there will be a concert this term. However, if you are interested, we highly encourage you to sign up  for our mailing list or check out our Facebook page regularly and we will send you more information as soon as we have a clearer idea about the format of TSO in MT 2020.
