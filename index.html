    Welcome to <b>Oxford Open Freshers' Fair 2020</b>. Our Freshers' Fair is complementary to the Student Union's fair. The Student Union was unable to accommodate many societies, so we created this website to be an inclusive online space for student societies and organisations.

  <p>Click on a society's image to
    find out more about it, see an FAQ, and join a video call with some of
    the current members.

  <p>Freshers' Week 2020 is over, but this site remains active partly to help provide information to students during the year, and also in anticipation of Freshers' Week 2021, when an open Freshers Fair may again be of value to students.</p>

      What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
      and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
      dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
      of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
      not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
      typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
