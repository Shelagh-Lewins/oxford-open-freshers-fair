Welcome to OUCA!

We are the largest student party-political society in Europe, and are always looking to welcome new members to our Association. 

OUCA is most well-known for Port and Policy, the weekly social and debating event which we host every Sunday evening of term. Our popular and regular socials include pub trips, poker nights, quizzes, parties, ice skating, punting, and a Termly Dinner every 8th week.

We also organise a range of other activities, including charity work in Oxford, and speaker events with politicians, journalists, or other public figures.

Our main aim is to champion Conservatism at the university and beyond. We also offer support to Conservative Party candidates, whether they are campaigning for seats in Oxford or around the country.

Our events and talks are open to any and all, regardless of membership, and we welcome students of all political views or none.
