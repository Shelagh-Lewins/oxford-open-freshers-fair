First Love is a Christian faith society with the motto 'Love God, Love others.' 
Aims:
We aim to hold weekly meetings which will attract students from diverse backgrounds. Our meetings and events will be open to all students whether they have a faith or not. Student members will have the opportunity to actively use their talents and be challenged by biblical based readings and discussions.
We aim to develop the leadership skills of our members. We will do this by forming smaller dance and singing groups with our society which will perform weekly in our meetings, term events and larger scale gatherings with the wider First Love Societies network.
We will aim to hold a number of events throughout the academic year in addition to our weekly meetings. These events will aim to promote our society and make Christianity more accessible and relevant to the student community.
Benefit to students:
First love society offers an open environment to explore faith through various activities and the opportunity to meet like minded students.The society is differentiated by its established and expansive network across the UK and internationally. This facilitates valuable networking, socialising and development opportunities for student members.
