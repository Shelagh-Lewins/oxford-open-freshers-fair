We are one of Oxford's long-standing classical chamber choirs, consisting of around 25 singers. We perform a wide variety of repertoire, from Early Music to contemporary choral music (but also, on occasion, jazz and pop). We are a fun, friendly, and inclusive group, led by a professional choir director. We have many exciting plans for the upcoming year, including choir tours.
