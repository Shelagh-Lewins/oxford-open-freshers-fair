We are a student-led society set up to promote Synthetic Biology within Oxford University and the wider region. 
In the light of the pandemic, we have shifted to delivering our seminar series online, opening an avenue for academic researchers as well as industry experts to share their work with SynBio enthusiasts around the globe. Recent webinars featured Tom Ellis and Pamela Silver and have given insights into the workings of companies like Ginkgo Bioworks and Cambridge Consultants. We are keen to continue hosting a diverse set of speakers to highlight the many fascinating topics of research and to shed light on careers in the SynBio academia and industry.
