Q: Do I need to be able to sight-sing?
A: No. A quick ear and enthusiasm to put in the extra time required can be just as good.

Q: What's the time commitment like?
A: 2 hours once a week for rehearsals, and performances as and when we want. As per the previous question, we need everyone to be able to hold their own line and we don't like spending time 'note bashing' in rehearsal, so you may want to spend a bit of time prepping for rehearsals, too.

Q: What voice parts are you looking for?
A: Any! We adapt our arrangements to our available voices. At the moment, we could do with a bass or two, or if you are skilled at vocal percussion we'd be very interested, too, but we're keen to hear from anyone, especially as the line-up will be changing during the year.

Q: When are auditions?
A: We're not having a set auditions day, but if you send us an email to beatrootsacappella@gmail.com then we'll give you the details of how to register your interest in auditioning.

Q: What sort of performances do you do?
A: Our own or joint concerts; college balls; charity fundraisers; weddings; competitions; public engagement events for researchers etc etc... we keep being surprised by the opportunities that arise! We go on tour once a year for a long weekend in the summer. And record in the studio - our first album came out last year, and the second will be recorded this coming year.

Q: What sort of music do you sing?
A: Whatever takes our fancy - we arrange our own. But it tends to centre around feel-good pop with a touch of tongue-in-cheek humour. At the moment we have fans of jazz, funk, soul, folk, and 80s, so they're heading the repertoire right now. Please find us on YouTube, Spotify, and Facebook to take a look and a listen!
