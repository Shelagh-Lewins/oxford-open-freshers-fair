The Choir of Exeter College is one of the leading mixed-voice choirs in Oxford, and is the only student-led choir to sing three services a week. We also record CDs, broadcast, and tour internationally â€” in 2021 to Saxony to sing at the churches where J.S. Bach, Mendelssohn, and Martin Luther were each active.
