Every show is completely different, made up on the spot and entirely based on audience suggestions.
The Imps are a mainstay of the Oxford comedy scene, and have put on regular shows since 2004. The lineup comprises a happy mixture of students and locals from in and around Oxford, UK, who perform improvised comedy similar to Whose Line Is It Anyway?
We mix short-form and long-form improv; you can expect anything from scenes, songs, Shakespeare, raps and much more... all made up on the spot!
