We are a student-led science outreach society who run interactive science events in Oxford and around the UK every year. We believe that science is fun and relevant to everyone! We aim to spread our enthusiasm for science to children and their families by taking a range of hands-on experiments into schools and public venues, with helpful student volunteers explaining the science behind the experiments. Throughout the year, we take experiments to public events, and run an annual summer roadshow, visiting schools throughout the UK.
