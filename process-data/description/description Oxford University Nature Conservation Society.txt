We aim to raise awareness of nature conservation  within the student community by holding free weekly talks on both global and local conservation issues from experts in the field. We also hold regular practical conservation and nature activities throughout the year where students can get involved and learn more about a variety of different topics. In the coming terms we also hope to collaborate further with other environmental societies at Oxford.
