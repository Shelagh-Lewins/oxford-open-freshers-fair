Q: What type of events do you hold? 
A:  We host talks on the newest research on psychedelics, including their medicinal application, history and culture. We also hold social events with lots of live music and tie-dyeing, as well as healing events like cocao ceremonies and breath workshops. Due to COVID-19, all events in Michaelmas term will be held virtually over Zoom, but we promise we have a super exciting line up ahead! 

Q: How can I get involved? Do I have to pay to be a member? 
A: Just show up to our events! Membership is completely free and we invite both Oxford students and local residents to get involved. Sign up to our mailing list to stay up to date with our events, and then just bring yourself and your friends along!

Q: Can I buy drugs from you? 
A: No. Any advertising of or soliciting for illicit drugs on any of our social media, forums or facebook group will be deleted immediately.
