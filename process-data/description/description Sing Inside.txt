Sing Inside is a national charity taking singing workshops into prisons. We visit several local prisons for day trips and use group singing to break down social barriers. You don't have be a singer or a leader to be involved. We sing popular songs and everyone is taught in a workshop together. It is a hugely rewarding society to be part of and the feedback we receive from residents is amazing. We hope you can join us!
