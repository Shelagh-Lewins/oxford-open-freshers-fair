We are the University of Oxfordâ€™s Sri Lanka society and we provide a space that brings people together to celebrate Sri Lanka and all it has to offer. We enjoy putting on curry nights, cricket matches and have branched out to zoom socials over lockdown. We look forward to seeing you at some of our events soon!
