Jacari is an innovative, award-winning student charity that matches up student volunteers with disadvantaged children aged 7-16 who don’t speak English as their first language (EAL) and are struggling at school. We want every child to reach their full potential.
Our student volunteers spend an hour a week helping a pupil with their language skills and general confidence. This one-to-one support has been proven to improve academic performance at school and raise the child’s confidence outside the classroom.
We also hold fun events and outings for children involved in the Jacari scheme, and within the university sphere we seek to raise awareness of the issues facing the communities we work in through events for students and the public.
We recruit and train student volunteers on an ongoing basis and hope you will be one of them!
