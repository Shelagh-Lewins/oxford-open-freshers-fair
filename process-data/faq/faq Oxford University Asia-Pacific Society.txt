Q: Is there a membership fee? 
A: No -- our society is open for all to join, without any membership fees. 

Q: What kind of events do you host?
A: We aim for our society to be a platform to connect students from the Oxford Asia-Pacific community. As such, we host a number of social events (think president's drinks, food fairs, lunar new year celebrations, and garden picnics). We also host a number of corporate and recruitment events to connect members to careers in the Asia-Pacific and beyond. This term, we still plan on hosting events where possible, while adhering to government guidelines. 

Q: How often do you host events? 
A: we aim to host three events per term (in week 1/2, week 4/5, and week 7/8).
