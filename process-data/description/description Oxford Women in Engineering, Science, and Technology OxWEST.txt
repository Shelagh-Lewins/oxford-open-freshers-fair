OxWEST (Oxford Women in Engineering, Science, and Technology) is one of the largest student-led societies at the University of Oxford. We promote gender equality in STEM subjects by supporting women studying or working in these fields, spreading awareness of diversity issues in STEM, and encouraging community members to become advocates. We have termly events and an annual conference as well as a mentoring programme run through out the academic year.
