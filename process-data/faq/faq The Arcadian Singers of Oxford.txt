Q: What do you do?
A: We are a classical chamber choir led by a professional Director of Music, performing a wide range of repertoire from Early Music to contemporary choral music. We are a friendly and inclusive group of undergraduates, postgraduates, and young professionals.

Q: How are you different from the other choirs?
A: We tackle exciting and unusual repertoire that you won't usually get to sing in a chapel choir. Over the years we have sung a very broad range of new and old music (with a focus on classical music, but with the occasional foray into jazz and pop). Take a look at our website to get an idea of the music we have sung over the past years: http://www.arcadiansingers.co.uk/past-concerts.html

Q: When do you rehearse?
A: We rehearse on Thursdays during term time, 7.15-9.45pm.

Q: What are auditions like?
A: We will ask you to bring one prepared piece. There will also be some exercises to test your vocal range and your sight-reading, but you are not expected to have perfect sight-reading skills!

Q: What are your plans for this year?
A: As things currently stand, we will be rehearsing in person as a full choir when term starts as we are lucky enough to have a large, well-ventilated space to work in. We have a stringent safety plan and risk assessment in place so that rehearsals can be both safe and valuable. We also have two tours planned for next year (COVID permitting).
