Q: What is Synthetic Biology?
A: Synthetic Biology is an emerging discipline at the interface of life sciences and engineering and revolves around (re-)designing organisms based on engineering principles. This is done for a wide variety of applications ranging from diagnostics and therapeutics to biofuel production and meat alternatives. 

Q: Who are we?
A: SynBio.Oxford is run by students with an interest in Synthetic Biology at the University of Oxford. Although the 2020 committee consists only of postgraduate students, the society is open to both undergrads and postgrads, and our events are both free and open for absolutely anyone to attend! 

Q: What is our purpose?
A: Originally founded to establish an iGEM team at the University of Oxford, SynBio.Oxford now has the broad aim to provide a hub for SynBio enthusiasts in Oxford and the wider region. The society promotes Synthetic Biology by showcasing exciting new research frontiers, but also highlighting commercial applications and ethical concerns around new technologies.

Q: What do we do?
A: The main responsibility of the committee currently is to invite synthetic biologists from academia and industry for our webinars and to promote these on social media. We also send out a biweekly newsletter highlighting SynBio-related news and events in the UK and worldwide. 
Despite the Covid-19 restrictions this year, we have managed to organise multiple webinars with various speakers from world-leading institutions around the world. We have featured speakers from academia, e.g. Pamela Silver (Harvard University) and Tom Ellis (Imperial College London), and got exciting insights into the SynBio industry from Paulina Kanigowska (Ginkgo Bioworks) and Matthew Jones (Cambridge Consultants). You can find recordings of some of our webinars on our website.
