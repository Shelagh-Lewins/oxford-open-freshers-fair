If I donâ€™t want to join yet, can I join the band later in the year?
Yes! Although we would love to meet you as soon as you join the university, we will be happy to welcome you to the band at any time. We are a student-run group, and less formal than some of the other university-wide ensembles as we hold no auditions. Thus, we are very happy to accept new-comers at any point. 
Are your rehearsals going to be safe considering the COVID-19 pandemic?
Yes. We have a dedicated COVID-19 officer who is responsible for managing our in-person meetings and ensuring there is a low risk for disease transmission. The guidelines set out by the university and OUMS are clear, and we will follow them carefully to ensure all our members are safe.
What format will your events be this year?
For the first term, we are expecting small-group rehearsals and a mixture of online and small-group in-person social events. At the moment, in-person concerts and full-band rehearsals are not possible. We may organise some online recorded performances, but these tend to be quite time-consuming so will not be possible during term time. We will continue to adapt everything we do to best suit the current situation and do as much playing as possible!
