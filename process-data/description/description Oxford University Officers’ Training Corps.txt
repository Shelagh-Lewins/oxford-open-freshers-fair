The Oxford University Officers' Training Corps (Oxford UOTC) offers a unique experience to university students looking to challenge and develop themselves, make life-long friends, and get paid.

You'll receive internationally recognised military and leadership training along with the opportunity to immerse yourself in a variety of sports and adventurous training activities. The training is designed to fit around your academic commitments and you are under no obligation to join the Regular Army or Army Reserves.

We accept students from across universities in Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Gloucestershire and provide unparalleled opportunities that can't be had anywhere else in university. As an officer cadet with the UOTC, you will get to make friends for life, challenge yourself in new ways, and go on adventures that can range from hiking in Nepal to skiing in France to kayaking in Canada!
