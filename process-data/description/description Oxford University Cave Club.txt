Caving is one of the most unusual sport clubs you might find at university! It’s a team activity that involves walking, crawling, climbing and abseiling through underground passages. The club runs three types of trips: introductory trips and more advanced sport caving trips and exploratory trips, taking place at least every second weekend during term time, as well as an overseas expedition in July. We have many very experienced cavers; if you choose to try caving with us you’ll be in good hands. You don’t have to be fit or fearless: just willing to give it a go.
