The Donut Kings is the sweetest big band sound in Oxford, performing regularly across the city in college balls, parties and dance nights, along with formal concerts and the occasional tour! The jazz band is made up of (and run by) students in Oxford, and will be holding auditions in 0th/1st week. If you are interested in signing up for auditions, please get in touch at the fair or email us at donutkingsoxford@gmail.com.
