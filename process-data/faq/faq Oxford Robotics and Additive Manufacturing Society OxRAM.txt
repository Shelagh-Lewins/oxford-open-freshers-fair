Q: What projects do you guys host?
A: This year we have 3 main projects lined up: The robotics arm project, Varsity PacMan (a competition with Cambridge University), and Landmine Detection Project. We also offer open workshop and tools for you to work on any other projects you are interested in.

Q: Do I need to be an engineer to join? 
A: Nope. We have had students studying all sorts of degrees join our society. Our projects have varying levels of difficulty so no matter what your background is, you should be able to find a project that fits.

Q: Is there a membership fee?
A: We have a 10 pound membership fee.  OxRAM members have free unlimited 3d printing and access to all our workshop tools.

Q: What is our Covid policy?
A: OxRAM is committed to keeping our members safe. This is why for the first term all projects would be remote i.e. simulation based, conducted in small teams, or held outdoors.
