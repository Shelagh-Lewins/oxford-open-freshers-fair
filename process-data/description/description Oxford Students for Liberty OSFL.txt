OSFL holds weekly debates on both political and philosophical issues. For example, our first topic of Michaelmas will be "The unexamined life is the only one worth living".
Usually these debates are relatively small, so can afford to be informal. Our regular attendees have a wide spectrum of views (from anarchists to marxists), so as long as you're willing to contribute you should be able to fit in at our events.
Michaelmas events will be a mixture of physical and virtual. A ballot will be released a few days before each debate.
