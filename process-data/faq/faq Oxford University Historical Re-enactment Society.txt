Q: Who are you?
A: We are the Oxford University Historical Re-enactment Society, known as the Wychwood Warriors, and we are dedicated to recreating aspects of Anglo-Saxon and Viking life in early mediæval England.

Q: How do I find out more?
A: Message us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/wychwoodwarriors/ or check our Termcard http://wychwood.wikidot.com/termcard.

Q: Do I need any experience or historical knowledge?
A: No! We welcome complete beginners, as well as seasoned re-enactors, and everyone in between. Most members are not historians, so you don’t need any expertise - just interest!

Q: What are you doing this term?
A: Each Thursday evening we're running an online session to:

- demonstrate and where possible try out crafts and costume-making.
- talk about a particular aspect of Dark Age life, such as weapons, board games, monastic life, or Anglo-Saxon literacy.
- perform a play based on a Viking myth or Saint's life.
- play a light-hearted roleplaying game set in the late 9th century. Please join in! So far we've wrestled bears, solved a murder and travelled to Byzantium.

Battle Practice ran in Michelmas as pre-booked one-on-one sessions. We hope to expand this in Hilary term to groups of up to six people using sword and spear (spear being an excellent way to keep your enemies at a 2m distance). BP is outdoors and masks are required.

We have a more casual online meeting on Sunday afternoons for chit chat and another game.

Q: What do you plan to do later in the year?
A: Later in 2021 we hope to resume our regular activities which include:

- weekly kitmaking sessions where you can make your own Anglo-Saxon or Viking clothing, and learn crafts such as chain-mail and tablet weaving
- sword and shield training
- bonfire with pizza and songs
- Dark Age feast
- day trips to re-enactors markets and local historic sites
- public displays like our February 2020 day at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford
- crafts and cookouts at Rumwoldstow (https://www.rumwoldstow.org/)
- our big event: the Easter weekend (1-6 April 2021) living in costume at the Danelaw village, Yorkshire Museum of Farming (https://www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk/), on display to the public during the day and gathering round a fire in the longhall at night.
