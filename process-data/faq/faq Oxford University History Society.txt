Q: What sorts of events do you put on?
A: We run mostly speaker events with pre-eminent historians, but we also run social events such as President’s Drinks and pub quizzes. A new addition for this year will be career focussed events, giving our members an insight into the paths they can take with a history degree.

Q: How has the pandemic affected your events?
A: All our events will be virtual for Michaelmas term. Our speaker events will be hosted over Zoom, and the virtual platform means we have invited speakers from outside the UK as well! As for our social events, we have done a virtual pub quiz in the past and will continue to put out virtual social events this term. 

Q: Do I have to be studying history to attend events or be a member?
A: No! Anyone from any degree discipline can attend our events or be a member. To attend our events you need to either be a member or pay the non-member attendance fee.

Q: Why should I become a member?
A: Members get free access to all our speaker events, and discounted access to all other events. This is a lifetime membership so if you stay on at Oxford after your degree you will still be able to attend events! 

Q: How much is membership and how do I sign up?
A: Membership is £15 for life. You can sign up for membership on our website at www.ouhs.org/membership. 

Q: What is the level of commitment needed?
A: It’s up to you! You can come to as many or as few events as you want. You can also get more involved by being on our committee, with roles such as secretary, events officer and sponsorship director. We will open applications for our Hilary term committee at the end of Michaelmas, so keep an eye out!

Q: How can I find out more?
A: You can visit our website www.ouhs.org or email president@ouhs.org. Our social media is @ouhistorysociety on Instagram and ‘Oxford University History Society’ on Facebook.
