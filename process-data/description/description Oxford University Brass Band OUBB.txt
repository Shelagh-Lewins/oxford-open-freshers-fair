OUBB is the University's official brass band. A part of OUMS, the university music society, OUBB normally rehearses once per week in the music faculty and hosts regular concerts, as well as participating in national competitions such as UniBrass. While unable to gather as a full ensemble under the current COVID-related rules, the band will continue to operate in small chamber groups and will prepare to regroup for next term. If you are interested in getting involved (either now or later in the year when the band is rehearsing in full), please get in touch and sign up for our introductory social!
