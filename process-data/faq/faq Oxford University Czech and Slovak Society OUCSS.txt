Q: What kind of events does the OUCSS organise?
A: We organise various events of both entertaining and educational character – and many of them will probably have a bit of both.  One of our largest events is the Velvet Dinner which is held every year to celebrate the events of the 17th November, and apart from the formal dinner itself, it usually involves a speech of a renowned speaker from the Czech or Slovak Republic. However, there are many less formal social events and other talks with Czech or Slovak guests as well. In the past, we have had the chance to talk to many interesting speakers, including Michal Horáček, Bohdan Pomahač, and Karel Janeček – and we are looking forward to seeing many more this year. You can find out more about our events on the OUCSS facebook page.

A: You can visit the ‘Become a Member’ section (https://oucss.co.uk/members/becoming-a-member/) on our website where you can read more about our membership and perform an online payment of the membership fee (you can also pay in cash at any of our events). The 2020/21 membership fee is £10.
