Oxford University Light Entertainment Society (OULES) is a non-profit amateur dramatics group that produces comedy musicals, all written by our members, to raise money for charity. We put on a play three times each year, at the end each term. We have a focus on encouraging first-time actors, writers and directors, and anyone who auditions gets a part - so what's not to like? :)
