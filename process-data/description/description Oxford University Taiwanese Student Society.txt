Established in 1987, the Taiwanese Student Society (OUTSS) aims to provide a warm and welcoming environment for Taiwanese students and their friends in Oxford. Our events include academic seminars, informal talks, sports, public film screenings, traditional food and drink events, etc. Through the OUTSS, we seek to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwanese culture.
