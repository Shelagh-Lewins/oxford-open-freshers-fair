Q: What is Scottish Dancing?
A: Scottish Dancing is the traditional dance of Scotland. There are two main disciplines; Country, and Highland. We mostly focus on Country Dancing, which is similar to ceilidh or barn dancing. You dance in a couple and join up with other couples to form a set. From there you dance various moves and figures as the dance requires! 

Q: What do you do?
A: Usually we hold a Beginners' Class and an Advanced Class every week, taught by professional dance teachers. We also hold at least one ceilidh during term as well as the End of Term Dance. We often hold one-off classes such as Highland Dancing (includes swords) or Ladies Step. We hold several socials during the term such as film night and punting.

Q: Do I need to bring a partner?
A: It isn't necessary! Feel free to bring a friend along but we mix and match partners throughout the evening.

Q: Do I need to have any experience?
A: We welcome dancers of all experience levels. Complete beginners are more than welcome! There's a reason we called it 'Beginners' Class'.

Q: What are you doing this term if you can't meet in person?
A: We are planning to hold a virtual class each week, alternating between Country and Highland Dancing. We are also planning to have virtual socials throughout term.
