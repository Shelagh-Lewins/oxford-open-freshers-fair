Q:  Is the ceilidh band auditioned and what instruments do we accept?
A:  We are completely non-auditioned, we accept any instruments, and any level of folk experience!

Q:  Is the band rehearsing in person in Michaelmas?
A:  This is hard to say currently because of government guidelines changing constantly, but we aim to have a few outdoor, distanced rehearsals so we can meet everyone properly, before the weather gets cold.  During our virtual tour we found a number of activities that work well over Zoom, including ways of rehearsing, so we know we have a plan that works to fall back on.

Q:  When and where does the band perform?
A:  We normally do a public ceilidh once a term.  This term we will attempt a Zoom ceilidh!  In normal times, we have a private gig around once a week, and you can pick and choose which and how many gigs you do.
