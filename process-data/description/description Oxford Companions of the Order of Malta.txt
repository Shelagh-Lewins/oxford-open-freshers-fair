One of the largest student volunteering groups in Oxford. We volunteer with the homeless, the elderly and children with special educational needs. We distribute food and hot drinks to the homeless community of Oxford almost every day and provide much needed companionship to others in need. No regular commitment needed, sign up to our mailing list and simply sign up for activities as and when works for you.
