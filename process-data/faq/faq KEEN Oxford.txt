Q: What does KEEN do?
A: We run social and recreational activities for kids and young adults, aiming to promote an inclusive environment for everyone and especially those with special needs and disabilities. Usually, we run a number of arts and sports sessions in Oxford throughout the week, but since COVID we're moved completely online. We're now running about 8 online sessions a week, ranging from drama to yoga to chat rooms.

Q: How do I get involved?
A: Get in touch with us! You can do that through signing up to the mailing list on our website, messaging us on any of our social media platforms, or dropping us an email at keen@keenoxford.org. We can get you set up as a college rep, helping us build our network, and/or you can get involved in our sessions. Let us know what you're like to do - and we'd love to hear from you!

Q: What's the time commitment like?
A: No commitment at all! Come along to a session, see if you like it, come back if you do! Some of our regular volunteers come to the same session each week, some come to a couple of sessions a week, and some come to a different session every couple of weeks - it's completely up to you.
