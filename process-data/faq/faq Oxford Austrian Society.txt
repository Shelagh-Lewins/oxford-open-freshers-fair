Q:What kinds of events does the Austrian Society organize, and how often do these take place?
A: We organize a range of different events, mainly socials, like (for now physically distanced) picnics and pub/ board game nights, talks and discussions.  We aim to hold events every 1-2 weeks, and we often collaborate with other societies from Oxford or Austrian societies from across the UK. 

Q: Do I have to be Austrian in order to get involved with the Austrian Society?
A: No, not at all! We welcome anyone who is interested in anything related to Austria - it doesn't matter if you are actually from Austria or not. 

Q: What would I get out of getting involved with the Austrian Society?
A: You'll meet lovely people and intriguing speakers, be part of a welcoming community, learn more about an exciting country and occasionally even get free cake! (Austria is famous for being great at anything baking-related.)
