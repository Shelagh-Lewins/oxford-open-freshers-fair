The Oxford University Psychology Society aims to explore the foundations of psychological knowledge as well as learn about innovations in the field. We host a number of psychology-related talks each term with prominent speakers who provide unique insights into their work. Past topics have included the psychology of dreams, cognitive enhancement, the mystery of consciousness, and the neuroscience of love & attraction, to name just a few. All of this is done in a relaxed and friendly setting where you can ask questions and chat with our speakers.

Film nights, pub quizzes, and our popular PsychSoc formal dinner are great opportunities to unwind and meet fellow members of the PsychSoc community. We also host several careers events to help you gain an awareness of potential career routes for psychology graduates and learn from advisors with experience in this area. 
 
Whatever your interest in psychology, whether you're an expert or know nothing, we always welcome new faces so feel free to drop into our events at any point during the year!
