Quidditch is a fast growing, extremely inclusive, mixed gender sport that’s perfect for anyone looking for something fun and slightly different to do at University. As a mix of Handball, Dodgeball and Rugby, it is unlike any other sport in the world.
Since no one has really had a chance to try Quidditch before coming to Uni, everyone gets to start on at the same level regardless of how much sport they may have done beforehand. We train Wednesdays and Sundays every week, and go to national tournaments to compete against university teams across the country! Even if you want something more casually though, you’ll always be welcome at trainings.
Finally, everyone at OUQC is super welcoming and we have weekly socials on Thursday evenings where we just have a bit of a laugh.
