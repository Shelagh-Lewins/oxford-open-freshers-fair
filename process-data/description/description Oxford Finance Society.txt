Founded in 1990, the Oxford Finance Society (OFS) is the largest financial careers student society at the University of Oxford, representing over 4,000 members. We aim to promote financial careers to the students of the university, equipping them with the skills, knowledge and opportunities they require through a diverse range of events run throughout the year. Every year our alumni go on to work for the most prestigious companies in finance, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley.
We run over 100 events every year and our term card is always full with an exciting programme of opportunities. Our workshops and interactive case studies give students hands-on finance experience and the chance to learn from industry professionals. We also host a number of presentations and networking events with our sponsor companies, allowing members to build meaningful connections within the industry.
