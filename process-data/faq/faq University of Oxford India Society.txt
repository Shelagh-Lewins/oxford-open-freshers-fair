Q: What does the Oxford India Society do?
A: The Oxford India Society is a home away from home for the desi community. We put on various events ranging from Bollywood club nights to Diwali dinners to speaker events. In the past, we've also hosted movie nights, IPL screenings, and garden parties. We also have an annual cricket tournament with other cultural societies that takes place in Trinity. Due to Covid, many of our events will be taking place online but we're still working on finding ways to host a few in-person events. 

Q: What is the OIS parents scheme?
A:  The OIS parents scheme is very similar to college families that are usually run. You'll be paired up with someone from OIS who is doing a similar subject or is in the same college and this way you can ask any questions you have about settling into Oxford or even get to know some other desis personally!
