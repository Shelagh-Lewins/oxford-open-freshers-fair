Q: What is Sing Inside?
A: Sing Inside is a national charity which brings singing workshops into prisons across England. We are a local branch in Oxford and take workshops into 3 local prisons. We use group singing to break down social barriers and encourage creativity, confidence and a greater sense of self-worth.

Q: What does volunteering with Sing Inside involve?
A: As a volunteer on a workshop, you will spend a day or several days in a prison learning songs alongside residents, staff and other volunteers. Sing Inside's musical leaders (also students) will teach warm ups, vocal technique and songs to the whole group together, and the day will culminate in a performance opportunity within the prison. No musical experience is necessary - just enthusiasm and willingness to get involved!
