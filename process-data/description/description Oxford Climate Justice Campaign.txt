Oxford Climate Justice Campaign is a student-led organisation which focuses on campaigning for global climate justice. We organise and attend peaceful rallies and protests against climate injustice, such as at career events with fossil fuel companies present. Apart from direct action, we also focus on education and discussion about the most pressing issues relating to climate change and social justice. Our achievements include the divestment campaign, which saw the University pledge to divest its endowment from fossil fuels this year; we continue to campaign for fossil fuel divestment in the individual colleges of the University.
