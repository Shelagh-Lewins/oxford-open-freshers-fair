We are open to all students of the University of Oxford, both in undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, and to students of Oxford Brookes University. Members are able to discuss their ideas with speakers and among themselves in an informal setting, developing insights into topics that matter, from the economics of climate change to the role of biases in decision-making and economic models. Past speakers have included Ha-Joon Chang, Hal Varian and Tim Harford.
