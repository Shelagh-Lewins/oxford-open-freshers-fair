The Oxford PPE Society is open to all. Wherever you are in the world, you are welcome to join our live streams, listen to our podcasts, and attend our events. We are a society run by students, specifically dedicated to fellow students interested in politics, philosophy, and economics. We aim to put on exciting, relevant, and informative events and create a community where individuals can develop and discuss opinions on a wide range of topics. ​​ In the past, we have hosted many notable speakers including Sir Vince Cable, Cass Sunstein, John McCain, and Dominic Grieve. The coming term will see us continue to host the world's leading figures.
