Q: Are only Hungarians allowed to join?
A: Absolutely not! We welcome everyone interested in matters Hungarian or who just wants to meet us. The speaker events we hold are entirely in English, so anyone can tune in. In fact, at many of our events, we tend to have at least a couple of non-Hungarians, who are interested in the particular event and/or know someone from the Society. We have a welcoming and dynamic community with new members joining every year of course. 

Q: What sort of events do you have?
A: There's some uncertainty surrounding our events amidst Covid restrictions this year. Normally, we'd have all sorts of events from pub quizzes, picnics, formal dinners and other socials to film screenings and speaker events about various cultural topics. Before the pandemic, we had our unique Lángos & Láger every term, an evening of Hungarian street food, beerpong, cheesy Hungarian music and much merriment in St Giles Church. With the current restrictions, we'll move some events online, such as informal drinks, board games and speaker events; but we also plan to have some events exploring Oxford, which would definitely be offline. 
Our term card will be uploaded at our website.

Q: Are events only for members?
A: Events are open to everyone but non-members usually have a higher fee, while most are free for members. Termly membership costs £5, while yearly membership costs £10.
