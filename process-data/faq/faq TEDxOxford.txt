Q: What is TEDxOxford?
A: TEDxOxford is brought to you by a passionate group of university students who believe in TED’s core mission of bringing ideas worth spreading to local communities and global audiences. Our team is dedicated to providing a platform that boasts a diverse, inclusive and innovative selection of talks that reflects an ever-evolving intellectual landscape. This year, our theme is "Brave New World," seeking to explore how the world will respond to and adapt from the plethora of political, environmental and health-related crises 2020 has brought to bear. With combined ambition, creative effort and months of hard work, our team promises a remarkable conference that piques curiosity, prompts critical thinking, and inspires change. Ultimately, we hope to deepen people’s understanding of the world, promote empathy and encourage individuals to become the best versions of themselves by pursuing intellectual rigour.

Q: How will TEDxOxford run this year?
A: With the pandemic, TEDxOxford has decided to shift our conference to virtual platforms. All our talks will be streamed in February 2021 via our Facebook, Instagram and Youtube pages.
