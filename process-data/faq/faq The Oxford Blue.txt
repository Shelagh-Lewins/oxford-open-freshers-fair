Q: What is The Oxford Blue? 
A: The Oxford Blue is Oxford’s first independent student newspaper in over 30 years. We are also Oxford’s first digital-only news platform. You can find our content on our website at www.theoxfordblue.co.uk and across Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Spotify where you’ll find our articles, video interviews, podcasts and more! 
Since The Blue’s conception in January 2020, we have published 800 articles by 280 writers ranging from Culture to Lifestyle and Global Affairs; had over 316k website views; been mentioned in the national and international press 30 times; been shortlisted for 3 awards and been translated into Hebrew, Spanish and Norwegian.
The paper was founded on an ethos of access and accountability, and as a disruptive new voice in Oxford we want to help students get involved with journalism regardless of their background or experience. Our team is made up of our talented and wonderfully promising writers, Editors and Business staff, all of whom are largely new to journalism. 
In addition to our published content we also aim to provide insight into an industry that often feels imprentable and dominated by certain demographics through our events such as our journalism series where we talk to journalists from across the world to learn from their experiences and perspectives. 

Q: Why is there more than one student paper in Oxford? 
A: The student journalism scene at Oxford is vibrant and diverse and we're one of three newspapers at the University. Each publication has its own culture, values and niche which means as a writer and reader you can find a space that fits your needs. 
The Oxford Blue specifically is the first independent newspaper Oxford in 30 years, and the only news publication which creates exclusively digital content. Not only does this mean we break important stories quickly, but we're also able to use the most innovative technology in journalism to bring those stories to life.

Q: How do I get involved with the Oxford Blue?
A: Become a writer by joining any of our contributors groups, which are open to all members of the Oxford community irrespective of whether you have past experience working in student journalism. Writers essentially work freelance - they can pick up commissions they fancy or they can pitch us their own ideas, but can do as little or as much as they want within that. Writers make our paper. Without them, we would not be able to publish the diverse and high quality content that we do:
