Q: What advice would you give new students?
A: Make sure you make a good strong start to your studies. Don't get trapped into thinking you shouldn't be here because everybody else seems so clever. Make efforts to introduce yourself to people. Make the most of all the opportunities that Oxford has to offer. If you are a Catholic, make yourself known to the Chaplaincy and to your Catholic College Rep, and find your way to the Chaplaincy! :) If you are having difficulties, don't hesitate to speak to someone. There are lots of people to support you.

Q: How do you help students to adapt to university life?
A: One of the things that certainly helps is the familiar routines from home life; it is also very important that they encounter highly intelligent people who believe what they believe, and find in their Catholicism a reliable way of conducting their life. There are many social and spiritual occasions for students which are a great help; and we also offer opportunities for one to one conversations.

Q: I'm not a Catholic but am thinking of becoming one. Where can I find more information?
A: Thank you for your interest. The first step would be to speak to one of the Chaplains. You can find more information about them here: https://www.catholic-chaplaincy.org.uk/home/student-chaplaincy/about-us/meet-the-chaplains/
