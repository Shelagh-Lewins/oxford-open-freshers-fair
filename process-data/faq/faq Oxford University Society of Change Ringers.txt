Q: What is Bell-Ringing?
A: Bell-ringing is a traditional past-time whereby groups of people (a band), sound church bells by pulling a series of ropes in a particular sequence, known as a method.

Q: What does the society do?
A: We have weekly practices on Tuesday evenings (followed by a trip to the pub), and Sunday service ringing, as well as many other social and ringing events during the term. These include outings, cheese and wine, punting, an annual dinner, competitions, and an annual tour! 

Q: What skills do you need?
A: Ringing is one of the few hobbies which is truly open to all. Everyone is welcome! There are no prerequisites: you need not be religious, musical, scientific, academic, or artistic (although being any of these things does not exclude you).  However, learning to ring takes a long time so you must be dedicated and prepared to attend regular teaching sessions. 

Q: What are you doing during the lockdown?
A: During the lockdown, we are continuing to meet weekly online to ring virtually and to socialise! Where possible, we hope to have some socially-distant socials and to ring handbells. We will resume our weekly tower-bell practices and teaching sessions later in the year, when safer.

Q: How can we get involved?
A: Pop into our teams session, or send us an email at master@ouscr.org.uk, we'd love to hear from you! We can give you the details for our events this term, answer any questions, or add you to our mailing list.
