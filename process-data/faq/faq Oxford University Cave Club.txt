Q: what is caving and potholing and is there a difference?
A: Is there a difference? Not really; “caving” tends to imply going into underground passages more-or-less horizontal, and “potholing” going up and down passages more-or-less vertical, but most cave systems have bits of both. “Caving” will do for both.

Q What does the club do?
A:The club runs three types of trips: introductory trips and more advanced sport caving trips and exploratory trips, taking place at least every second weekend during term time, as well as an overseas expedition in July.

Q: How much does it cost?
A:Membership is free for your first term and after that costs £23 per year. Weekend trips are £40 including food, accomodation and transport. Day trips are £25 including transport and lunch.

Q:Is it OK if I've never been caving before?
A:Yes, absolutely, you'll be in good company. The club has many very experienced cavers; if you choose to try caving with us you’ll be in good hands. Most people have never caved when they first join the club, and those who have caved before have usually only done it once or twice with Scouts etc. It's a (nice) surprise when we get a new member with a significant amount of caving experience.

Q:Is it OK if I'm a graduate student/ visiting student / not part of the University at all?
A:Yes, we're far from being an undergraduate only club. A lot of new people joining the club are graduate students and visiting students, and people from outside the University are welcome too, especially if you can drive or stick around long enough to lead trips.
