Q: Who are you?? 
A: Oxford’s first and only all women* funk/soul band. We are a 14 piece band (rhythm, horns and singers) who play the kind of music that you literally can’t not groove to- think Aretha Franklin, Britney, Lizzo, ABBA, Prince etc. 

Q: How often/where do you play?
A: In normal covid-free times, we have regular gigs playing at some of Oxford's best balls, parties, music nights etc. To name a few of our personal highlights: supported Pixie Lott at John's ball in Cambridge, 3 balls in one night (!), Oxford pride, waved multicoloured umbrellas around to 'raining men'. We aim to rehearse once a week.

Q: Who are you auditioning?
A: Just singers for now but keep an eye on our social media because we may have other instrument auditions later in the year!

Q: What are your plans for the coming term?
A: It is unlikely that we will have any gigs this term.. instead our plan is to jump on the band wagon of virtual performances, so we’ll all be recording parts separately and then merging them oooer. We’ll also try to sort some new arrangements and of course organise socials!
