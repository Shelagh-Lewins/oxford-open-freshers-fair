Q: Is our club beginner friendly /are there many beginners / do I need any experience?
A: Around half of our members each year have been complete beginners to all martial arts and virtually all our new members haven't done MMA before. We are a friendly club where beginners can learn from those who are more experienced way. 

Q: Do we have competition/ Is there a serious aspect?
A: Yes, as well as being open to beginners we also have a cadre of members with more experience who have fought at least once a year in Muay Thai, BJJ or MMA. We are a new club but managed to have our first ever Oxford vs Cambridge MMA fight last year which was an exciting event.

Q: Will I get beaten up?
A: Don't worry about this! We in fact don't allow beginners to do any form of hard striking sparring until they have been at the club for some time and have demonstrated control and good understanding of a wide variety of techniques. Most of our sparring is light, we are a gym that doesn't believe in making our members take unnecessary damage in training.

Q: What is the boy/girl ratio?
A: There are more men than women at our club but we have about 20-30% women and one of our women competed against Cambridge last year.
