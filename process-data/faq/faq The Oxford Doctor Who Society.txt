Q. I've never watched Doctor Who before. Can I still join? 
A. Absolutely! We specially select the very best of Doctor Who in the first term so you get the best possible introduction. 

Q. How are you getting around the pandemic? 
A. We'll be meeting online in order to maintain social distancing standards and guidelines.

Q. What do you get up to each week?
A. Each week, the Society watches a 'Doctor Who', or two, depending on length. There's an interval half-way through, plus time at the end, for people to chat and get to know one another.

Q. How often do you meet?
A. Typically once a week, however sometimes more if there's a special event happening too, like the Geek Quiz, for example.

Q. Is it free to join the Society?
A. Normally there would be a small membership fee. This term, however, people can become 'Virtual Members', which comes with access to the Society FaceBook chat, for free, so you can try the Society out and, if you wish to pay to become a full member later on, you can.
