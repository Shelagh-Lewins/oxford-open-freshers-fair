Q: How can I get involved with OxHOS?
A: The two best ways to get involved is to volunteer with us or join the committee. Our committee produces all of our experiments, organises the roadshow and makes sure all our events run smoothly! The committee changes annually in late Michaelmas term, so keep your eye out for details. Alternatively, you can volunteer with us, joining us at events or on the roadshow and running our hands-on experiments with children. There are opportunities to volunteer with us throughout the year; the best way to hear about these are by joining our mail list.

Q: What kind of events do you take experiments to?
A: We take experiments to several public events in Oxford throughout the year (and are always looking for new events to go to!). However, our main event each year is the summer roadshow.

Q: What is the summer roadshow?
A: The summer roadshow is an annual event, where we take our experiments on the road and visit schools in other parts of the UK. This occurs in the three weeks after Trinity Term has ended. We normally spend one week in Oxford, then take our experiments to a couple of new places in the UK. Previous roadshows have included Manchester, Essex and the Peak District. It’s completely free to take part and we cover food, accommodation and travel expenses for our volunteers!

Q: Do I need any experience to be an OxHOS volunteer or committee member?
A: Absolutely not! You don’t need to have any experience volunteering or in science outreach. You don’t even need to be studying a science degree. The only requirement is an enthusiasm for science outreach!
